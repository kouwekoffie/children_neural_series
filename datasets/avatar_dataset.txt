The Silver Call


There is a godhead of unrealised things
To which Time's splendid gains are hoarded dross;
A cry seems near, a rustle of silver wings
Calling to heavenly joy by earthly loss.


All eye has seen and all the ear has heard
Is a pale illusion by some greater voice
And mightier vision; no sweet sound or word,
No passion of hues that make the heart rejoice


Can equal these diviner ecstasies.
A Mind beyond our mind has sole the ken
Of those yet unimagined harmonies,
The fate and privilege of unborn men.


As rain-thrashed mire the marvel of the rose,
Earth waits that distant marvel to disclose.
Krishna

           At last I find a meaning of soul's birth
           Into this universe terrible and sweet,
     I who have felt the hungry heart of earth
         Aspiring beyond heaven to Krishna's feet.


     I have seen the beauty of immortal eyes,
        And heard the passion of the Lover's flute,

     And known a deathless ecstasy's surprise
       And sorrow in my heart for ever mute.


    Nearer apd nearer now the music draws,
         Life shudders with a strange felicity;
    All Nature is a wide enamoured pause
        Hoping her lord to touch, to clasp, to be.


    For this one moment lived the ages past;
   The world now throbs fulfilled in me at last
The Inner Fields


There is a brighter ether than this blue
Pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,
Royaler investiture than this massed assault
Of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.
Immortal spaces of cerulean hue
Are in our reach and fields without this fault
Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
In their deep murmur which white flowers strew

Floating like stars upon a strip of sky.
This world behind is made of truer stuff
Than the manufactured tissue of earth's grace.
There we can walk and see the gods go by
And sip from Hebe's cup nectar enough
To make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face.
Liberation

I have thrown from me the whirling dance of mind
And stand now in the spirit's silence free,
Timeless and deathless beyond creature-kind,
The centre of my own eternity.

I have escaped and the small self is dead;
I am immortal, alone, ineffable;
I have gone out from the universe I made,
And have grown nameless and immeasurable.

My mind is hushed in a wide and endless light,
My heart a solitude of delight and peace,
My sense unsnared by touch and sound and sight,
My body a point in white infinities.

I am the one Being's sole immobile Bliss:
No one I am, I who am all that is.
At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty --
A dazzling spectacle of rising moon and sun.

So far, the wayfarers have not discovered your footprints:
They stand staring at the stepstone of your door

Your glance of abundant grace did not satisfy;
We with the seeing eye know a glance from a glance.

Saqi, they've just arrived and taken their seats;
How is it that they've already gained intimacy?

Some you inspire with the madness of prostration:
They cannot tell their heads from your door.

Saqi, whoever comes by even a tinge of awakening
We see sitting in your assembly, oblivious to this world.

Men who are maddened by the thought of the goal
See not fellow travelers -- they are intent on the road.

Master, in what strange state your Darshan lives:
We always see his eyes moist with tears.
I Am All

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I am the blue firmament and the black cloud,
I am the waterfall and the sound thereof,
I am the graven image and the stone by the wayside,
I am the rose and the falling petals thereof,
I am the flower of the field and the sacred lotus,
I am the sanctified waters and the still pool,
I am the tree that towereth among the mountains
And the blade of grass in the peaceful lane,
I am the tender spring leaf and the evergreen foliage.

I am the barbarian and the sage,
I am the impious and the pious,
I am the ungodly and the godly,
I am the harlot and the virgin,
I am the liberated and the man of time,
I am the the indestructible and the destructible,
I am the renunciation and the proud possessor.
I am all
few know me.

I am neither This nor That,
I am neither detached nor attached,
I am neither heaven nor hell -- few know me --
I am neither philosophies nor creeds,
I am neither the Guru nor the disciple.
O friend,
I contain all.

I am clear as the mountain stream,
Simple as the new spring leaf.

Happy are they
That meet with me.

I walked on a path through the jungle

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I walked on a path through the jungle
Which an elephant had made,
And about me lay a tangle of wilderness.
The voice of desolation fills the distant plain.
And the city is noisy with the bells of a tall temple.
Beyond the jungle are the great mountains,
Calm and clear.

In the fear of Life
The temptation of sorrow is created.

Cut down the jungle -- not one mere tree,
For Truth is attained
By putting aside all that you have sown.

And now I walk with the elephant.
I have been a wanderer long from The Search

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I have been a wanderer long
In this world of transient things.
I have known the passing pleasures thereof.
As the rainbow is beautiful
But soon vanishes into nothingness,
So have I known,
From the very foundation of the world,
The passing away of all things
Beautiful, joyous and pleasurable.

As the moon is full and serene,
In the day of harvest
So am I
In the day of my Liberation
Simple as the tender leaf am I
For in me are many winters and many springs.
As the dew drop is of the sea,
So am I born
In the ocean of my Liberation

As the mysterious river
Enters the open seas,
So have I entered
Into the world of Liberation
This is the end I have known.
Annette

Annette,
At the dresser.
Pale fingers over mirror-fields
Reaping
That wheat brown hair.
Beauty
Falling as chaff in old mirrors,
While calenders
In all
The cities turn….

The moon is encircled by moons

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

The moon is encircled by moons.
How can I hold it
In my hands?
The unseizable moon,
Glowing in the brilliance
Of a million moons,
Rocks my head
In a lunar carnival....

Moon fruits adorn
The tree of the moon,
Flashing,
Luminously flashing.

I try to see
But my eyes cannot bear;
The rays of beauty
Dazzle them.

Songs of summer


I am happy, life is good.

 Heard at the end of a therapy class. . .
 The heavy-duty brainwashing and you
 Remember your crores stacked away. . .
 Your Harvard airs helps in large doses
 Soon, the colors peel away and there is nothing
 To do than wrestle with your yearnings.

I would like to make love.

 Wanna fuck? It is easier saying it this way
 For something that you paid for in cash
 And cheques and credit cards.
 Forget the lesser action, the lack of poetry
 What mattered was how you let go
 Of your hate and heat and hunger
 But never had the courage to talk
 To her of love or loneliness. . .

You are trespassing on my territory

 You guarded it with LoCs and walls
 And barbed wire fences where hatred
 Danced like high-voltage electricity. . .
 You killed creatures and cleared forests
 And wiped away the darker people
 And those of dreamy tongues with
 Your agenda of a war-a-week, the
 Worlds-to-win and vengeance-to-wreak. . .
 Your Mushroom clouds and wmds and
 Poverty drafts and armchair chivalry and
 A collective manhood of nuclear warheads
 That explode and penetrate. . .

She’s mine.

 To make her yours and yours alone,
 You pushed her deeper into harems
 Where she could see the sunlight
 Only from the lattice windows.
 Domesticated into drudgery she was just
 Another territory, worn out by wars. A slave
 Who maintained your numbers.

Let’s make love.

 ~all that you thought~
 What’s taking her so long to undress?
 Quick! Sooner!
 ~all that you said~
 I m gonna fuck till ya faint. . .

Oh how nice to have made love.

 ~breathless~ Iminahurry. Cyasoon.~panting~

Here are the words, again
I am happy. Life is good / I would love to make love.
You are trespassing on my territory/ She’s mine.
Let’s make love/ Oh how nice to have made love.

On sunny green fields these are the only
Six sentences the male of a grasshopper can ever say.

But what have we done with words?



Meeting the prophetess

Leave your books behind.

Since memory,
Like knowledge, is a traitor,
Erase every hoarding of your horrible past.

At last, when you enter her world
Of fraying edges and falling angels
Don’t barter words where touch will do and be the truth.
For once allow her silence to sear, strip your life-layers
Because she who knows the truth will not know the tale.



The flight of birds

a poem should be wordless
as the flight of birds.
Archibald Macleish, Ars Poetica.

birds don’t sing in their flight

for them flying is a muse
they compose mid-air
weave agnostic verse
sneering haughtily at our absurdity
as they float over our meaningless mosques and churches
and those patrolled international borders
and other disputed sites
where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
they swing over there losing their birdegos
ego is difficult to retain in mid-flight
wondering about and watching men plucking out
and quashing the lives of other men and women and
poor helpless children and they
shed a birdtear or two from there
a birdtear that is lost midway due to heat of some explosion
down below some crazy fanatical bomb detonating
killing instantly the people and the city and the forests
and even the pitiable babybirds who are yet to learn to fly

they contemplate of writing poems
about a bird’s egg charring
before even being boiled and scratch their beaks
unsure if this is a metaphor or simile or other poetic device

o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about
o their writings will never be banned

they borrow freedom
to write poems in the sky
they come back and
pass it on to us
we take the song only
brutally
but at least we take the song

to take the poem
to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again
as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song
to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us
and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity
perhaps we need to fly
a trifle aimlessly like birds

or because we are humans
six-sensed creatures with massive egos
and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
and because of possessing gray matter
what doctors call medulla oblongata
we need to feel with our red hearts
than think with some unlocatable mind

we need to look deeper. . .
into ourselves, into eyes
we need to lose ourselves
then, and only then

the poems will come
silent
wordless
as the flight of birds

is a problem unlike your never-ending
paper or the maddening blankness of
your word processor where you can go on
and on in anguish or insanity or boredom
on one-hundred-and-seven degree Fahrenheit afternoons.
To write the next lines you need to take
the greengoldbrown duster to rub off these eight

Colour is another confusion you want
to wish away. At sixteen you wouldn’t write
OneSingleWord unless it was forty percent
gray letters on a plum background and your
monitor looked like a high class youknowwho.
The font then was Footlight MT Light, 13 pt.
Now, at twenty one, it is Verdana, eight point.

NOTHING SEDUCES LIKE YOUR OWN HANDWRITING.
THE WHITE CHALK DANCING ACROSS GLASS GREEN.
Creepers on W’s  R’s, hats on S, hearts on I’s  J’s.

I have erased again

I don’t grudge the colours too. Instead of two hundred
and fifty six fantasies there is the catholic bridal white.
Sometimes, there is yellow, blue, green, purple, red and
orange and the opportunity of giving them names

Flaky Fullmoon. Bleached  Faded Captain Haddock Suit.
Temple-tank Algae. Crushed Lilac Under Flashlight.
Sherbet Stain. Sawdust Chillidust Cream.

I have erased again

There is considerable exertion let me hazard a guess:
writing takes two hundred calories per hour, erasing
with the duster five hundred, and walking across must
be say, around eighty. Then, there is chalk-dust allergy
that compels me to sneeze. And the chemical after-effect
that spoils the moody brown skin of any glowing goddess.

And the unbearable sounds
of chalk squeak. . .
I have erased again.
The fifth time now.

But, a poet loves
writing blackboard poems.
So easy, to imagine, an audience
Yet, how much she dreads
Impermanence. . .



Returning home

And you see the two-crows-for-joy-pass that are sitting on
overhead cables and the evening moon,
a mere silvery slice against fluffy translucent sky.

And the remains of your school where you spent your twelve
longest years and lived through everything.

And the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow
ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the
place where a tiny café once stood.

And the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk
back home. And I thought of my parents.

Brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of
morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddear-
departed parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.

And you are their child,
so you speak their lines.
Still returning home,

And there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like
the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.

And girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip
gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into
oblivion.

And the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises
and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.

And the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight
and sound and smell and touch yes touch.

And I thought of my lover.

A primitive man who would invade
your aloneness on insomniac nights
and challenge your assumptions of
love and your sophistications and fill
your ears with the four letter words of
his ancient language that have begun
to sound to you like earth songs to
which your body awakens.

And you are his love,
so you listen to his lines.

On the way home, the small
lessons you learn of life. . .
Love, or the promise of love,
its lack of choice.
This large world.
And its littleness.


Cinquains

Morning Song

Wet pink
And dusty grey
The sky begins to blush.
Some sleepy careless charm welcomes
Daybreak.

Even Song

Azure
And pink gold hues
The smug sky at twilight
A final flush of fulfilment
Night falls.


Sun in the mouth

And the truth scorches and singes
the pink open flesh of your mouth
with its pungent yellow taste, so,
speaking the truth is not so easy
with just one tongue, anyway.

Seeing might have been closest
to truth and as Plotinus said
the eye would not be able to see
the sun if it was itself not sun
and so seeing was understanding.

The Egyptians called the eye
with the circle of the iris
with the pupil in the centre
as the sun in the mouth
and that was their truth.

Cyclops must have had little
to see in this vast world and
deprived of the whole truth
and that was his loss, his tragedy.

Even Argus with all his eyes
couldn’t escape in the end.
How much truth, how many eyes
of how many senses would it take
to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?

A king of a Tamil temple city
raged mad to know the truth
of the scent of a woman’s hair.
Since money bought truth
he made ready, a thousand gold coins.

And a poor poet still married to faith
prayed on to Shiva, the lord of struggling
survivors, lord of births and lives and
deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him
a poem to be sung at the king’s court.

A savant there picked a mistake like
peeling the scab of a healed wound
and said that the poem was wrong.
He said that any woman’s hair
did not have a natural scent.

The lord of dances and grey ash
and cremation grounds came down
to challenge this stubborn man who
extended his truth, even if the woman
was the consort of the lord.

He would not budge even if the lord
threatened to open his third eye,
the eye in the forehead which would
reduce him to bone-white ashes
as light as the wispiest clouds.
The court cowered in fright. . .

But in arrogance the savant said
a mistake is a mistake
even if it was the lord
of the forehead-eye.

O’ saint-bard and master of many wily words
What do you know of truth or love,
or the scent of a woman’s hair?
On the nights of naked sky and
a fragile quarter moon, my lord,
he of the deep blue throat,
he of the rivers in his hair,
he of the third-eye, comes to me.
Before he tears the blankness
of my womb, before he traces
the length of my spine, the curve
of my thighs, before he strokes
my cheeks, he buries his head
in the thousand and one nights
of my long tresses and he says
it smells like the wind-lost voices
of his childhood summers.



The Gods wake up

Another worst things with the Gods is that
They sleep most of the time
                          they don’t even dream.
If you happen to go near heaven:
It is a very noisy boring place.
And all that you get to hear there are
Thirty three million synchronized godly snores.
                          The Goddesses snore too.

The Gods sleep right through the prayers
Performed by the Brahmins
                          maybe they find it boring.
Births, Marriages, innumerable yagnas,
Brahmins take the center-stage, all the
Gods skip. Also, Om is now obsolete
a kind of recurring mosquito buzz.
                          Besides, Om is ©opyrighted.

At times, the sleeping celestials do stir.
Gods always get excited over funerals
                          they are kind of necrophilic.
The loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep,
Ancient noises herald the escaping life.
This deeper music shakes the skies.
That’s when the Gods wake up.
                          Just to receive the dead.


When the God drank milk


This was the second time
He spanned the world
So quickly. . . In telecast
miracles that occurred from
Michigan to Manila to Madras
Whether He was in plastic, ceramic,
Fire-burnt clay or stiff black stone
The Elephant-Headed, the Pot-Bellied,
The Remover of Obstacles, Ganesha,
The God had his fill as he sucked
The spoonfuls of creamy milk. . .

I am not willing to listen to
Capillary Action Rationalism
Or any scientific explorations. . .

Instead I am hunting for some
Silly girl’s bizarre secret, to know if
The Son of Shiva had let himself
To be breastfed, to be suckled. . .
And if she, having tasted success
At His having tasted her,
Moved on to younger,
Charming Gods,
With their mouths
Full of white teeth.

Non-conversations with a lover

don’t talk to me
of sudden love. . .

in our land
even the monsoons come
leisurely, strolling like
decorated temple elephants
the pomp, the paraphernalia
after months of monotonous prayer,
preparations and palpitating waits.

my darling
his silence
those still shoulders
but his eyes dance
his eyes dance
so wild, so wild

so i think of raging
summer storms
like uncontrollable tuskers
trampling in mast
the madness, the lust
across the forests of our land. . .

full of the words of my language.

an english in small letters
an english that shall tire a white man’s tongue
an english where small children practice with smooth round
 pebbles in their mouth to the spell the right zha
an english where a pregnant woman is simply stomach-child-lady
an english where the magic of black eyes and brown bodies 
   replaces the glamour of eyes in dishwater blue shades 
   and the airbrush romance of pink white cherry blossom skins
an english where love means only the strange frenzy
   between a man and his beloved, not between him and his car
an english without the privacy of its many rooms
an english with suffixes for respect
an english with more than thirty six words to call the sea
an english that doesn’t belittle brown or black men and women
an english of tasting with five fingers
an english of talking love with eyes alone

and i dream of an english

where men
of that spiky, crunchy tongue
buy flower-garlands of jasmine
to take home to their coy wives
for the silent demand of a night of wordless whispered love . . .







Excerpts from a study guide

Teach him not to seek
Where he has been taught to find. . .



Lead him into the land
Of silencesIgnore his words of praise
Where all the perfidy hides. . .



Because the climax of a dream
Is its return to reality, let him cling
To your laughter, to your eyes that shine of light. . .



Make him study the gilt of gold
Against the wan brown of your skin but let him choose. . .



Exhibit your flawless arms
Dearest child of 1984no vaccination mark
Nothing to remind him of his Maari or small pox. . .



Lead him to count the moles
On your skin but force him to begin
With the beauty spot above your lips. . .



Talk to him of that summer of chickenpox
That left you almost unscathed, but show him
The unbeautiful gash where metal seared eight-year skin. . .



Tell him the history of your Raphunzel hair
That tickled your shins. And of a cruel world that sapped
You, so your hair cannot reach down to cover your shame. . .



Press his ears against your skin
And hear him announcethe dance
Is in the bones, the dance is in the blood. . .



He shall chart and plot
And map, but shrewd girl
Bring him up to worship you. . .



Allow him to memorize all of you
So that, some day, he shall ravish you
Screaming fiery love-words in your mother-tongue. . .



He would have
Learnt your lesson, by then. . .

Talk to me, javas, talk to me


How they prostitute a poem

It is uniquely easy
For some to sell
Ideals because
Business of absent
Goods is essentially
A sacrosanct but mostly
A flimsy transaction.

Some learn, early on,
To prostitute their verse.
So, in all the waking hours
They scavenge for a simple simile
That matches requirements, fulfills needs.

They barter reality
And every romance
To a blurred triplicate
Carbon-copy World of Hard
Cash and Price Tags and Brand Names.

In this brothel
Of stilled hope and
Stagnated stories, poems
Are born virgin and endowed
With voluptuous figures of firm,
Full breasts and wide hips where men
Prefer to plant their pastime dreams,
Or conceive their seed,
Or merely spite themselves,
Or dabble at domination.

But, the poem, with this
Bogus existence becomes
An adept, untiring prostitute.

Taken
On a starry night,
The poem opens
dry and drab and dreary:
lacking love and life like
The paid-for parting
Of the thighs.

Aggression

Ours is a silence
that waits. Endlessly waits.

And then, unable to bear it
any further, it breaks into wails.

But not all suppressed reactions
end in our bemoaning the tragedy.

Sometimes,
the outward signals
of inward struggles takes colossal forms
And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

Most of the time:

Aggression is the best kind of trouble-shooting.






Authorship
You say that father write a lot of books, but what he write I don't
understand.
He was reading to you all the evening, but could you really
make out what he meant?
What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father
write like that, I wonder?
Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and
fairies and princesses?
Has he forgotten them all?
Often when he gets late for his bath you have to and call him
an hundred times.
You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on
writing and forgets.
Father always plays at making books.
If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me,
What a naughty child!
If I make the slightest noise you say, Don't you see that
father's at his work?
What's the fun of always writing and writing?
When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book
just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me
then, mother?
You never say a word when father writes.
When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't
seem to mind at all.
But if I take only one sheet to take a boat with, you say,
Child, how troublesome you are!
What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of
paper with black marks all over both sides?
 Fireflies
My fancies are fireflies,  
Specks of living light
twinkling in the dark.

he voice of wayside pansies,
that do not attract the careless glance,
murmurs in these desultory lines.

In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
dreams build their nest with fragments
dropped from day's caravan.

Spring scatters the petals of flowers
that are not for the fruits of the future,
but for the moment's whim.

Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber
rushes into numberless leaves,
and dances in the air for a day.

My words that are slight
my lightly dance upon time's waves
when my works havy with import have gone down.

Mind's underground moths
grow filmy wings
and take a farewell flight
in the sunset sky.

The butterfly counts not months but moments,
and has time enough.

My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,
carrying a single laughter.
The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
which yet it never can grasp.

Let my love, like sunlight, surround you
and yet give you illumined freedom.

Days are coloured vbubbles
that float upon the surface of fathomless night.

My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,
and therefore you may remember them.

Leave out my name from the gift
if it be a burden,
but keep my song.

April, like a child,
writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers,
wipes them away and forgets.

Memory, the priestess,
kills the present
and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.

From the solemn gloom of the temple
children run out to sit in the dust,
God watches them play
and forgets the priest.

My mind starts up at some flash
on the flow of its thoughts
like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
that is never repeated.

In the mountain, stillness surges up
to explore its own height;
in the lake, movement stands still
to contemplate its own depth.

The departing night's one kiss
on the closed eyes of morning
glows in the star of dawn.

Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit
which is yet to mature,
tense with an unyielding secret.

Sorrow that has lost its memory
is like the dumb dark hours
that have no bird songs
but only the cricket's chirp.

Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand
with a grip that kills it.
Wishing to hearten a timid lamp
great night lights all her stars.

Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride,
the sky is ever immensely away.

God seeks comrades and claims love,
the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.

The soil in return for her service
keeps the tree tied to her,
the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.

Jewel-like immortal
does not boast of its length of years
but of the scintillating point of its moment.

The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,
unobscured by the dust of history.

Alight laughter in the steps of creation
carries it swiftly across time.

One who was distant came near to me in the morning,
and still nearer when taken away by night.

White and pink oleanders meet
and make merry in different dialects.

When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.

The lake lies low by the hill,
a tearful entreaty of love
at the foot of the inflexible.

There smiles the Divine Child
among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
and ephemeral lights and shadows.

The breeze whispers to the lotus,
What is thy secret?
It is myself, says the lotus,
Steal it and I disappear!

The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
join hands in the dance of swaying branches.

The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.

The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
and yet to keep it for himself.

Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.

Clouds are hills in vapour,
hills are clouds in stone, 
a phantasy in time's dream.

While God waits for His temple to be built of love,
men bring stones.

I touch God in my song
as the hill touches the far-away sea
with its waterfall.

Light finds her treasure of colours
through the antagonism of clouds.

My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears
like a wet tree glistening in the sun 
after the rain is over.

I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,
but have failed to remember the grass
that has ever kept it green.

The one without second is emptiness,
the other one makes it true.

Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation
into a harmony with the whole.

They expect thanks for the banished nest
because their cage is shapely and secure.

In love I pay my endless debt to thee
for what thou art.

The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,
and the sun says, they are good.

Your calumny against the great is impious,
it hurts yourself;
against the small it is mean,
for it hurts the victim.

The first flower that blossomed on this earth
was an invitation to the unborn song.

Dawnthe many-coloured flowerfades,
and then the simple light-fruit,
the sun appears.

The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
throttles the voice that would cry.

The wind tries to take the flame by storm 
only to blow it out.

Life's play is swift,
Life's playthings fall behind one by one
and are forgotten.

My flower, seek not thy paradise
in a fool's buttonhole.

Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon,
but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.

Darkness is the veiled bride
silently waiting for the errant light
to return to her bosom.

Trees are the earth's endless effort to
speak to the listening heaven.

The burden of self is lightened
when I laugh at myself.

The weak can be terrible 
because they try furiously to appear strong.

The wind of heaven blows,
The anchor desperately clutches the mud,
and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.

The spirit of death is one,
the spirit of life is many,
Whe God is dead religion becomes one.

The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,
the wind between them sighs, Alas.
Day's pain muffled by its own glare,
burns among stars in the night.

The stars crowd round the virgin night
in silent awe at her loneliness
that can never be touched.

The cloud gives all its gold
to the departing sun
and greets the rising moon
with only a pale smile.

He who does good comes to the temple gate,
he who loves reaches the shrine.

Flower, have pity for the worm,
it is not a bee,
its love is a blunder and a burden.

With the ruins of terror's triumph
children build their doll's house.

The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
for the flame's kiss in the night.

Feathers in the dust lying lazily content
have forgotten their sky.

The flowers which is single
need not envy the thorns
that are numerous.

The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
of its well-wisher.

We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price
for our right to live.

Your careless gifts of a moment,
like the meteors of an autumn night,
catch fire in the depth of my being.

The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
promises a miracle of life
which it cannot prove at once.

Spring hesitates at winter's door,
but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him
before her time and meets her doom.

The world is the ever-changing foam
thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.

The two separated shores mingle their voices
in a song of unfathomed tears.

As a river in the sea,
work finds its fulfilment
in the depth of leisure.

I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,
but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.

Thy shy little pomegranate bud,
blushing to-day behind her veil,
will burst into a passionate flower
to-morrow when I am away.

The clumsiness of power spoils the key,
and uses the pickaxe.

Birth is from the mystery of night
into the grerater mystery of day.

These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
on the ripples of hours,
and not to reach any destination.

Migratory songs wing from my heart
and seek their nests in your voice of love.

The sea of danger, doubt and denial
around man's little island of certainty
challenges him to dare the unknown.

Love punishes when it forgives,
and injured beauty by its awful silence.

You live alone and unrecompensed
because they are afraid of your great worth.

The same sun is newly born in new lands
in a ring of endless dawns.

God is world is ever renewed by death,
a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.

The glow-worm while exploring the dust
never knows that stars are in the sky.

The tree is of to-day, the flower is old,
it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed.

Each rose that comes brings me greetings
from the Rose of an eternal spring.
God honours me when I work,
He loves me when I sing.

My love of to-day finds no home
in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.

The fire of pain tracse for my soul
a luminous path across her sorrow.

The grass survives the hill
through its resurrections from countless deaths.

Thou hast vanished from my reach
leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,
an invisible image in the wind moving
among the shadows.

In pity for the desolate branch
spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.

The shy shadow in the farden
loves the sun in silence,
Flowers guess the secret, and mile,
while the leaves whisper.

I leave no trace of wings in the air,
but I am glad I have had my flight.

The fireflies, twinkling among leaves,
make the stars wonder.

The mountain remains unmoved
at its seeming defeat by the mist.

While the rose said to the sun,
I shall ever remember thee,
her petals fell to the dust.

Hills are the earth's gesture of despair
for the unreachable.

Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me,
O Beauty,
I am grateful.

The world knows that the few
are more than the many.

Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend,
know that it pays itself.

Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,
and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.

Beauty is truth's smile
when she beholds her own face
in a perfect mirror.

The dew-drop knows the sun
only within its own tiny orb.

Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,
swarming in the air, hum round my heart
and seek my voice.

The desert is imprisoned in the wall
of its unbounded barrenness.

In the thrill of little leaves
I see the air's invisible dance,
and in their glimmering
the secret heart-beats of the sky.

You are like a flowering tree,
amazed when I praise you for your gifts.

The earth's sacrifical fire
flames up in her trees,
scattering sparks in flowers.

Foretsts, the clouds of earth,
hold up to the sky their silence,
and clouds from above come down
in resonant showers.

The world speaks to me in pictures,
my soul answers in music.

The sky tells its beads all night
on the countless stars
in memory of the sun.

The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,
the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.

Pride engraves his frowns in stones,
loe offers her surrender in flowers.

The obsequious brush curtails truth
in diference to the canvas which is narrow.

The hill in its longing for the far-away sky
wishes to be like the cloud
with its endless urge of seeking.

To justify their own spilling of ink
they spell the day as night.

Profit smiles on goodness
when the good is profitable.

In its swelling pride
the bubble doubts the turth of the sea,
and laughs and bursts into emptiness.

Love is an endless mystery,
for it has nothing else to explain its.

My clouds, sorrowing in the dark,
forget that they themselves
have hidden the sun.

Man discovers his own wealth
when God comes to ask gifts of him.

You leave your memory as a flame
to my lonely lamp of separation.

I came to offer thee a flower,
but thou must have all my garden,
It is thine.

The picturea memory of light
treasured by the shadow.

It is easy to make faces at the sun,
He is exposed by his own light in all
directions.

History slowly smothers its truth,
but hastily struggles to revive it
in the terrible penance of pain.

My work is rewarded in daily wages,
I wait for my final value in love.

Beauty knows to say, Enough,
barbarism clamours for still more.

God loves to see in me, not his servant,
but himself who serves all.

The darkness of night is in harmony with day,
the morning of mist is discordant.

In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,
it is food in the famished hour
when their petals are shed.

An unknown flower in a strange land
speaks to the poet:
Are we not of the same soil, my lover?

I am able to love my God
because He gives me freedom to deny Him.

My untuned strings beg for music
in their anguished cry of shame.

The worm thinks it strange and foolish
that man does not eat his books.

The clouded sky to-day bears the visior
of the shadow of a divine sadness
on the forehead of brooding eternity.

The shade of my tree is for passers-by,
its fruit for the one for whom I wait.

Flushed with the glow of sunset
earth seems like a ripe fruit
ready to be harvested by night.

Light accepts darkness for his spouse
for the sake of creation.

The reed waits for his master's breath,
the Master goes seeking for his reed.

To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,
its writing unmeaning.

The sea smites his own barren breast
because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.

The greed for fruit misses the flower.

God in His temple of stars
waits for man to bring him his lamp.

The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.
Released from bonds, the shameless flame
dies in barren ashes.

The sky sets no snare to capture the moon,
it is her own freedom which binds her.
The light that fills the sky
seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.

Wealth is the burden of bigness,
Welfare the fulness of being.

The razor-blade is proud of its keenness
when it sneers at the sun.

The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,
not the bee busily storing honey.

Child, thou bringest to my heart
the babble of the wind and the water,
the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,
the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.

The rainbow among the clouds may be great
but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.

The mist weaves her net round the morning,
captivates him, and makes him blind.

The Morning Star whispers to Dawn,
Tell me that you are only for me.
Yes, she answers,
And also only for that nameless flower.

Someone leaping from the rocks
Past me ran with windblown
locks Like a startled bright surmise
Visible to mortal eyes, 
Just a cheek of frightened rose
That with sudden beauty glows,
Just a footstep like the wind
And a hurried glance behind,
And then nothing,  as a thought
Escapes the mind ere it is caught.
Someone of the heavenly rout
From behind the veil ran out.
The Blue Bird


I am the bird of God in His blue;
Divinely high and clear
I sing the notes of the sweet and the true
For the god's and the seraph's ear.

I rise like a fire from the mortal's earth
Into a griefless sky
And drop in the suffering soil of his birth
Fire-seeds of ecstasy.

My pinions soar beyond Time and Space
Into unfading Light;
I bring the bliss of the Eternal's face
And the boon of the Spirit's sight.

I measure the worlds with my ruby eyes;
I have perched on Wisdom's tree
Thronged with the blossoms of Paradise
By the streams of Eternity.

Nothing is hid from my burning heart;
My mind is shoreless and still;
My song is rapture's mystic art,
My flight immortal will.
A God's Labour

I have gathered my dreams in a silver air
Between the gold and the blue
And wrapped them softly and left them there,
My jewelled dreams of you.

I had hoped to build a rainbow bridge
Marrying the soil to the sky
And sow in this dancing planet midge
The moods of infinity.

But too bright were our heavens, too far away,
Too frail their ethereal stuff;
Too splendid and sudden our light could not stay;
The roots were not deep enough.

He who would bring the heavens here
Must descend himself into clay
And the burden of earthly nature bear
And tread the dolorous way.

Coercing my godhead I have come down
Here on the sordid earth,
Ignorant, labouring, human grown
Twixt the gates of death and birth.

I have been digging deep and long
Mid a horror of filth and mire
A bed for the golden river’s song,
A home for the deathless fire.

I have laboured and suffered in Matter’s night
To bring the fire to man;
But the hate of hell and human spite
Are my meed since the world began.

The Dreamboat

Who was it that came to me in a boat made of dream-fire,
With his flame brow and his sun-gold body?
Melted was the silence into a sweet secret murmur,
Do you come now? Is the heart's fire ready?

Hidden in the recesses of the heart something shuddered,
It recalled all that the life's joy cherished,
Imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,
And the boat passed and the gold god vanished.

Now within the hollowness of the world's breast inhabits - 
For the love died and the old joy ended - 
Void of a felicity that has fled, gone for ever,
And the gold god and the dream boat come not.
I Have A Hundred Lives

I have a hundred lives before me yet
To grasp thee in, O Spirit ethereal,
Be sure I will with heart insatiate
Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.

Thou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way
And with awakened vision watch me come
Smiling a little at errors past and lay 
Thy eager hand in mine, its proper home.

Meanwhile made happy by thy happiness
I shall approach thee in things and people dear, 
And in thy spirit's motions half-possess,
Loving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,

Until I lay my hands on thee indeed
Somewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed.
The Unseen Infinite

Arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks
I meet no end, for all is boundless He,
An absolute Joy the wide-winged spirit seeks,
A Might, a Presence, an Eternity.

In the inconscient dreadful dumb Abyss
Are heard the heart-beats of the Infinite.
The insensible midnight veils His trance of bliss,
A fathomless sealed astonishment of Light.

In His ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,
Our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the One:
Only the eyes of Immortality dare
To look unblinded on that living Sun.

Yet are our souls the Immortal's selves within,
Comrades and powers and children of the Unseen.
Life

Mystic Miracle, daughter of Delight, 
Life, thou ecstasy,
Let the radius of thy flight
Be eternity.

On thy wings thou bearest high
Glory and disdain,
Godhead and mortality,
Ecstasy and pain.

Take me in thy wild embrace 
Without weak reserve
Body dire and unveiled face;
Faint not, Life, nor swerve.

All thy bliss I would explore,
All thy tyranny.
Cruel like the lion's roar,
Sweet like springtide be.

Like a Titan I would take,
Like a God enjoy,
Like a man contend and make,
Revel like a boy.

More I will not ask of thee,
Nor my fate would choose;
King or conquered let me be,
Live or lose.

Even in rags I am a god;
Fallen, I am divine;
High I triumph when down-trod,
Long I live when slain.
To Weep Because

To weep because a glorious sun has set
Which the next morn shall gild the east again;
To mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
Which by that force a double strength attain;
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
Joy could not be, to make a terror of death
Who smiling beckons us to farther life,
And is a bridge for the persistent breath;
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
Of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears
As rend the heart, though meant for its relief, 
And all man's ghastly company of fears
Are born of folly that believes the span
Of life the limit of immortal man.
Words

All round me are words, and words and words,
They grow on me like leaves, they never
Seem to stop their slow growing
From within... But I tell my self, words
Are a nuisance, beware of them, they
Can be so many things, a
Chasm where running feet must pause, to
Look, a sea with paralyzing waves,
A blast of burning air or,
A knife most willing to cut your best
Friend's throat... Words are a nuisance, but.
They grow on me like leaves ona tree,
They never seem to stop their coming,
From a silence, somewhere deep within... 

A Losing Battle

How can my love hold him when the other
Flaunts a gaudy lust and is lioness
To his beast? Men are worthless, to trap them
Use the cheapest bait of all, but never
Love, which in a woman must mean tears
And a silence in the blood. 


Forest Fire

Of late I have begun to feel a hunger
To take in with greed, like a forest fire that
Consumes and with each killing gains a wilder,
Brighter charm, all that comes my way. Bald child in
Open pram, you think I only look, and you
Too, slim lovers behind the tree and you, old
Man with paper in your hand and sunlight in
Your hair... My eyes lick at you like flames, my nerves
Consume ; and, when I finish with you, in the
Pram, near the tree and, on the park bench, I spit
Out small heaps of ash, nothing else. But in me
The sights and smells and sounds shall thrive and go on
And on and on. In me shall sleep the baby
That sat in prams and sleep and wake and smile its
Toothless smile. In me shall walk the lovers hand
In hand and in me, where else, the old shall sit
And feel the touch of sun. In me, the street-lamps
Shall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the
Wedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured
Skirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,
And in me the dying mother with hopeful
Eyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown
And gone away to other towns, other arms. 

My Grandmother's House

There is a house now far away where once
I received love……. That woman died,
The house withdrew into silence, snakes moved
Among books, I was then too young
To read, and my blood turned cold like the moon
How often I think of going
There, to peer through blind eyes of windows or
Just listen to the frozen air,
Or in wild despair, pick an armful of
Darkness to bring it here to lie
Behind my bedroom door like a brooding
Dog…you cannot believe, darling,
Can you, that I lived in such a house and
Was proud, and loved…. I who have lost
My way and beg now at strangers' doors to
Receive love, at least in small change? 


Punishment in Kindergarten

Today the world is a little more my own.
No need to remember the pain
A blue-frocked woman caused, throwing
Words at me like pots and pans, to drain
That honey-coloured day of peace.
‘Why don't you join the others, what
A peculiar child you are! '

On the lawn, in clusters, sat my
schoolmates sipping
Sugarcane, they turned and laughed; 
Children are funny things, they laugh
In mirth at others' tears, I buried
My face in the sun-warmed hedge
And smelt the flowers and the pain.

The words are muffled now, the laughing
Faces only a blur. The years have
Sped along, stopping briefly
At beloved halts and moving
Sadly on. My mind has found
An adult peace. No need to remember
That picnic day when I lay hidden
By a hedge, watching the steel-white sun
Standing lonely in the sky. 


Relationship

This love older than I by myriad
Saddened centuries was once a prayer
In his bones that made them grow in years of
Adolescence to this favored height; yes,
It was my desire that made him male
And beautiful, so that when at last we
Met, to believe that once I knew not his
Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness
Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me?
Yes, he can, but never physically
Only with words that curl their limbs at
Touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while
My body's wisdom tells and tells again
That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace
And even death nowhere else but here in
My betrayer's arms... 

Summer in Calcutta

What is this drink but
The April sun, squeezed
Like an orange in
My glass? I sip the
Fire, I drink and drink
Again, I am drunk
Yes, but on the gold
of suns, What noble
venom now flows through
my veins and fills my
mind with unhurried
laughter? My worries
doze. Wee bubblesring
my glass, like a brides
nervous smile, and meet
my lips. Dear, forgive
this moments lull in
wanting you, the blur
in memory. How
brief the term of my
devotion, how brief
your reign when i with
glass in hand, drink, drink,
and drink again this
Juice of April suns. 



The Dance of the Eunuchs

It was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came 
To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals 
Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling 
Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with 
Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and 
They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green 
Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some 
Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices 
Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of 
Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... 
Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts 
And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They 
Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from 
Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness 
Were in each of them. Even the crows were so 
Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; 
All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions 
The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning 
And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in 
Attics and the urine of lizards and mice.... 




The Maggots

At sunset, on the river ban, Krishna 
Loved her for the last time and left...

That night in her husband's arms, Radha felt 
So dead that he asked, What is wrong, 
Do you mind my kisses, love? And she said, 
No, not at all, but thought, What is 
It to the corpse if the maggots nip? 


The Old Playhouse

You planned to tame a swallow, to hold her
In the long summer of your love so that she would forget
Not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but
Also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless
Pathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge
Of yet another man that I came to you but to learn
What I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every
Lesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased
With my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow
Convulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured
Yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed
My poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife,
I was taught to break saccharine into your tea and
To offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering
Beneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and
Became a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your
Questions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer
Begins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes
Of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is
Always lit by artificial lights, your windows always
Shut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little,
All pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers
In the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is
No more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old
Playhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is
Always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,
For, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted
By its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last
An end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors
To shatter and the kind night to erase the water. 





The Rain

We left that old ungainly house
When my dog died there, after
The burial, after the rose
Flowered twice, pulling it by its
Roots and carting it with our books,
Clothes and chairs in a hurry.
We live in a new house now,
And, the roofs do not leak, but, when
It rains here, I see the rain drench
That empty house, I hear it fall
Where my puppy now lies,
Alone..






The Stone Age

Fond husband, ancient settler in the mind, 
Old fat spider, weaving webs of bewilderment, 
Be kind. You turn me into a bird of stone, a granite 
Dove, you build round me a shabby room, 
And stroke my pitted face absent-mindedly while 
You read. With loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, 
You stick a finger into my dreaming eye. And 
Yet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink 
Like white suns in the swell of my Dravidian blood, 
Secretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. 
When you leave, I drive my blue battered car 
Along the bluer sea. I run up the forty 
Noisy steps to knock at another's door. 
Though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, 
they watch me come 
And go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me 
What he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, 
A libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake 
Before it clasps my pubis. Ask me why like 
A great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, 
And sleeps. Ask me why life is short and love is 
Shorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price....





The Suicide

Bereft of soul
My body shall be bare.
Bereft of body
My soul shall be bare.
Which would you rather have
O kind sea?
Which is the more dead
Of the two?
I throw the bodies out,
I cannot stand their smell.
Only the souls may enter
The vortex of sea.
Only the souls know how to sing
At the vortex of the sea.
Your body shall be dead,
Poor thing,
Dead as driftwood, drifting
And drifting to the shore.
Your body shall ride the tide,
Rider, slumped dead
On white war-house.
Charging.
Your body shall bruise white
Against the coral reefs,
Your body,
Your lonely body.
I tell you, sea,
I have enough courage to die,
But not enough.
Not enough to disobey him
Who said: Do not die
And hurt me that certain way.
How easy your duties are.
How simple.
Only roar a hungry roar,
Leao forward,
And retreat.
You swing and you swing,
O sea, you play a child's game.
But,
I must pose.
I must pretend,
I must act the role
Of happy woman,
Happy wife.
I must keep the right distance
Between me and the low.
And I must keep the right distance
Between me and the high.
O sea, i am fed up
I want to be simple
I want to be loved
And
If love is not to be had,
I want to be dead, just dead
While I enter deeper,
With joy I discover
The sea's hostile cold
Is after all skin-deep.
The sea's inner chambers
Are all very warm.
There must be a sun slumbering
At the vortex of the sea.
O sea, i am happy swimming
Happy, happy, happy ...
The only movement i know well
Is certainly the swim.
It comes naturally to me.
I had a house a Malabar
And a pale-green pond.
I did all my growing there
In the bright summer months.
I swam about and floated,
And divided into the cold and green
I lay speckled green and gold
In all the hours of the sun,
Until
My grandmother cried,
Darling, you must stop this bathing now.
You are much too big to play
Naked in the pond.
Yes, the only movement i really know
Is swimming,
It comes naturally to me.
The white man who offers
To help me forget,
The white man who offers
Himself as a stiff drink,
Is for me,
To tell the truth,
Only water.
Only a pale-green pond
Glimmering in the sun.
In him I swim
All broken with longing.
In his robust blood i float
Drying off my tears.
Yet i never can forget
The only man who hurts.
The only one who seems to know
The only way to hurt.
Holding you is easy
Clutching at moving water,
I tell you, sea,
This is easy,
But to hold him for half a day
Was a difficult task.
It required drinks
To hold him down.
To make him love.
But, when he did not love,
Believe me,
All I could do was to sob like a fool.
O sea,
You generous cow,
You and I are big flops.
We are too sentimental
For our own
Good.
Lights are moving on the shore.
But I shall not return.
Sea, toss my body back
That he knew how to love.
Bereft of body
My soul shall be free.
Take in my naked soul
That he knew how to hurt.
Only the soul knows how to sing
At the vortex of the sea. 



The Sunshine Cat

They did this to her, the men who know her, the man
She loved, who loved her not enough, being selfish
And a coward, the husband who neither loved nor
Used her, but was a ruthless watcher, and the band
Of cynics she turned to, clinging to their chests where
New hair sprouted like great-winged moths, burrowing her
Face into their smells and their young lusts to forget
To forget, oh, to forget, and, they said, each of
Them, I do not love, I cannot love, it is not
In my nature to love, but I can be kind to you.
They let her slide from pegs of sanity into
A bed made soft with tears, and she lay there weeping,



Evolution revised

I passed into a lucent still abode
And saw as in a mirror crystalline
An ancient Force ascending serpentine
The unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.

Earth was a cradle for the arriving god
And man but a half-dark half-luminous sign
Of the transition of the veiled Divine
From Matter's sleep and the tormented load

Of ignorant life and death to the Spirit's light.
Mind liberated swam Light's ocean vast,
And life escaped from its grey tortured line;

I saw Matter illumining its parent Night.
The soul could feel into infinity cast
Timeless God-bliss the heart incarnadine.
God

Thou who pervadest all the worlds below,
Yet sitst above,
Master of all who work and rule and know,
Servant of Love!

Thou who disdainest not the worm to be 
Nor even the clod,
Therefore we know by that humility
That thou art God.
Friend 

Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair. 

I have no sleep tonight. 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me. 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me, my friend?
The Astronomer 

I only said, When in the evening the round full moon gets
entangled among the beaches of that Dadam tree, couldn't somebody
catch it?
But dada laughed at me and said, Baby, you are the silliest
child I have ever known. The moon is ever so far from us, how could
anybody catch it?
I said, Dada, how foolish you are! When mother looks out of
her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far
away?
Still dada said, You are a stupid child! But, baby where
could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?
I said, Surely you could catch it with your hands.
But dada laughed and said, You are the silliest child I have
known. If it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is.
I said, Dada, what nonsense they teach at your school! When
mother bends her face down to kiss us, does her face look very
big?
But still dada says, You are a stupid child.


The Gardener XIV: I Was Walking by the Road 

I was walking by the road, I do not
know why, when the noonday was past
and bamboo branches rustled in the
wind.
The prone shadows with their out-
stretched arms clung to the feet of
the hurrying light.
The koels were weary of their
songs.
I was walking by the road, I do not 
know why.
The hut by the side of the water is
shaded by an overhanging tree.
Some on was busy with her work,
and her bangles made music in the
corner.
I stood before this hut, I know not
why.
The narrow winding road crosses
many a mustard field, and many a
mango forest.
It passes by the temple of the
village and the market at the river
landing-place.
I stopped by this hut, I do not know
why.
Years ago it was a day of breezy
March when the murmur of the spring
was languorous, and mango blossoms
were dropping on the dust.
The rippling water leapt and licked
the brass vessel that stood on the 
landing-step.
I think of that day of breezy March,
I do not know why.
Shadows are deepening and cattle 
returning to their folds.
The light is grey upon the lonely
meadows, and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank.
I slowly return upon my steps, I
do not know why.
Paper Boats

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream.
    In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live.
    I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am.
    I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night.
    I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
    I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats!
    When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
    The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams.

The Royal Tombs Of Golconda

I MUSE among these silent fanes 
Whose spacious darkness guards your dust; 
Around me sleep the hoary plains 
That hold your ancient wars in trust. 

I pause, my dreaming spirit hears, 
Across the wind's unquiet tides, 
The glimmering music of your spears, 
The laughter of your royal brides. 

In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire 
To make your names oblivion's sport, 
While yonder hill wears like a tier 
The ruined grandeur of your fort. 

Though centuries falter and decline, 
Your proven strongholds shall remain 
Embodied memories of your line, 
Incarnate legends of your reign. 

O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed 
Your flower-like bodies to the tomb; 
Death is in truth the vital seed 
Of your imperishable bloom 

Each new-born year the bulbuls sing 
Their songs of your renascent loves; 
Your beauty wakens with the spring 
To kindle these pomegranate groves. 

Surprise! Surprise!

I dreamt death came the other night
And heaven's gate swung wide;
With kindly grace an angel came
To usher me inside.

Yet there to my astonishment
Stood folks I'd known on earth,
Some I had judged as quite unfit
Or of but little worth.

Indignant words rose to my lips
But never were set free;
For every face showed stunned surprise
NO ONE expected me! 

This morning’s surprise

This morning’s surprise is how much I’ll miss rail travel.
The green fields looming up and falling behind,
the milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup,
the engine’s steady vibration.

This afternoon’s surprise is how many shades of red there are,
each one sitting in a room of its own, dense in meditation.
Each one a field of conflict, a medium of conciliation.

This evening’s surprise is not that the novel ends
in a desultory return to the working week -
loose ends trimmed and tucked out of sight -
but the ferocity of my recoil
at the author’s glib contrivance.

Midnight’s surprise is Lorca’s moon floating over Hackney
full-faced, round-eyed and speaking Spanish.

Surprise Surprise Surprise

My Honey's a Gem and he pampers me
and promised his love eternally.
Valentine's Day
was coming our way--
What beautiful gift would I see?

The day broke clear that early morn.
I expected a package with bow adorned.
But, Woe is me!
No gift did I see!~
I was feeling so sad and forlorn!

My Honey had a Smirk on his face
as he took me into his embrace.
He said, Close your eyes--
There's a big surprise!
I balled up my fist, just in case!

Blindly, I was led to the lawn
while I kept asking, What's going on?
He said, Wait and See--
I'm sure you'll agree--
All your worries will soon, be gone!

Alas, I became so excited
and my inner-fires ignited!
I felt so elated 
and anticipated
that I would be so delighted.

Slowly, I opened my eyes
and much to my surprise--
What did I see
in front of me ??
A Clothesline with all it implies!

Now, the laughter filled the air!
I didn't show signs of despair.
I took control
and embraced the pole--
He'll soon, have Starch in his Underwear!











Surprise Surprise Pretty Surprise

Oh boy, a brand new slate
You're all in for a HUGE surprise, just wait
You thought I had money before?
Now I'll be sweating money from my pores
This is just in time
Seriously I'm on cloud nine!


surprise, surprise surprise

never know whats in store for me for today,
doctors or patients,
ear pain, back pain or stuffed throat?

Surprise, Surprise!!

When you started talking to me again yesterday,
It took me by complete surprise.
I didn't know what to say really, I was in total shock.
I still am even after reading the whole conversation again. 

You seem to have had a change of heart, but I'm not sure why.
I'm glad that you did though, because I missed talking to you.
Maybe you realized that I had no part of it,
That it was all just a misunderstanding.

I still can't believe that you wanted to see me before you left,
After telling me not to talk to you any more.
Then to see the words You can call me some if you want.,
Has just really blew my mind!

I'm still not sure what to think of it all,
I guess you can say that I am kind of confused.
All of a sudden here you are saying you want to chill with me,
After telling me that you had changed your mind about anything else.

You acted just as interested as you did before,
So I can't help but ask, What's up?
Have you changed your mind, had a change of heart?
I sure hope you have, I had high hopes of it being more.

So I don't know where this will lead,
I have to wait a while to see because you have already left,
But I guess only time will tell!
It is really up to you though, my friend.


Surprise, Surprise

I called you once and you didn't respond
even though you specifically said to call you sometime.
Okay, that's alright, maybe you were busy
or didn't hear it.  Either way, maybe I should try again later.
.
.
Again, nothing.  Alright, I'll leave a message,
Even though I hate having to talk to a machine.
I'll call sometime tomorrow.

Once again nothing, maybe you're ignoring me,
Maybe I was wrong to hope
that you and me...
Forget it.


Okay one more time, yes you answered!
You'll be coming down later?
Awesome, great!  I'll be waiting.
And waiting.  And waiting.
I'll go watch TV.

What? you were here?  When?  You just left, no NO!
Okay, I'll try again.  No answer...
The next day, no answer...
One more time, nothing... Maybe she doesn't like me
after all.  Curse that god damned hope.  It got me again.

Surprise, Surprise

One moment can tell a story for years, 
Passed down with twists and turns... 
But no matter how many distortions are made, 
it is the original that is truly yours. 

'Twas the first day of school, 
such an interesting day, 
I walked the halls nervously
A lack of words to say. 

Turning a corner, 
I look up and around:
A teacher asks a boy for his name, 
I myself shocked by the sound:

The name has been spoken 
and time seems to stop; 
I look up at the boy in confusion
and feel my jaw drop. 

No way! Is it really him?
You? He? That guy?
The one I thought lost
now returned, how? why? 

Was he not gone for such a period
that I'd thought his return unseen:
Now this even is so abrupt! 
It happened so quickly...

surprise surprise.

We're best friends
You  I
but i love you
and your brown eyes

Just a boy and a girl
never torn apart
afraid to date
afraid to start

Never felt like this
Never opened up my heart
till just lately
now i know wasn't smart

you told me before
we'll be together soon
but today you changed your mind
now everything seems ruined

I don't know what to say
My face a blank stare
Tears flowing out my eyes 
Life really isn't fair

You say you can't lose me
And you didn't want to hurt me
but there was no way around it
now i ask you to let me be

I need time to let you go
I need space so i can think
I'll never open up my heart again
For it to only sink

Your still my best friend
I'll always wish we were more
but i respect your wish
Tho my feelings were tore.


Apparently with no surprise,
To any happy flower,
The frost beheads it at its play,
In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on.
The sun proceeds unmoved,
To measure off another day,
For an approving God.

My heart went fluttering with fear
Lest you should go, and leave me here
To beat my breast and rock my head
And stretch me sleepless on my bed.
Ah, clear they see and true they say
That one shall weep, and one shall stray
For such is Love's unvarying law....
I never thought, I never saw
That I should be the first to go;
How pleasant that it happened so!

As there I left the road in May,
And took my way along a ground,
I found a glade with girls at play,
By leafy boughs close-hemmed around,
And there, with stores of harmless joys,
They plied their tongues, in merry noise:
Though little did they seem to fear
So queer a stranger might be near;
Teeh-hee! Look here! Hah! ha! Look there!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so fair.

And one would dance as one would spring,
Or bob or bow with leering smiles,
And one would swing, or sit and sing,
Or sew a stitch or two at whiles,
And one skipped on with downcast face,
All heedless, to my very place,
And there, in fright, with one foot out,
Made one dead step and turned about.
Heeh, hee, oh! oh! ooh! oo!—Look there!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so fair.

Away they scampered all, full speed,
By boughs that swung along their track,
As rabbits out of wood at feed,
At sight of men all scamper back.
And one pulled on behind her heel,
A thread of cotton, off her reel,
And oh! to follow that white clue,
I felt I fain could scamper too.
Teeh, hee, run here. Eeh! ee! Look there!
And oh! so playsome, oh! so fair.

I lift the toliet seat
as if it were the nest of a bird
and I see cat tracks
all around the edge of the bowl.

There is element of surprise
Even it is in sudden demise
Why does the sun always rise?
It can stay at home otherwise

So many things do happen or take place
They may prove disastrous even if you are not in race
You will have to deal it as fresh case
Not to loose the hope in any case

Is it not wonderful to be in this world?
All memories to be preserved and kept in fold
Why to worry about changing seasons?
It is varying from person to, person'

World may not end with our thinking
Thoughts may not stop with your sinking
You may drawn in sea or jump from sky
It will never end the question why

Try to be reasonable with simple fact
There is no use to offer resistance or to react
It may be your fate and must be accepted
Lines must be drawn choice must be opted

Future destiny makes you strong or weak
You should face the challenge and guidance to seek
You must stand alone in the lonely island
Must make it hospitable with many more friends

It may not bally your expectations
You may emerge powerful without any citation
It is your destiny and you must give shape
You should remain vigilant and never be trapped

Everything has its own time and future
It may rise and end with specific tenure
What are we thinking about future trend?
Try to adjust and make some mends

Have you ever ventured in hot sun?
Have you ever tried for shelter and run?
If not, then leave it for future option
Answer should not found before arrival of question


We get perturbed over slight setback
We don’t address it but make role back
Why do we think it as permanent tragedy?
Can we not laugh it out and make it as comedy?

"Evil spirits

You are possessed.
Witch doctors believe in phantoms,
that cause your illness. But, driving out devils
can be challenging. Spirits are given away

We are made to sit opposite you,
Force-fed a ‘meal’bland food mixed
with your hair, nails, spit and pus.
Illegally despite the government ban,
We take your hoard of evil spirits
Barter-system: for having ate your food.

And because ghosts and ghouls
obey your rules, they leave you to come to us.
Is this ‘transference’? An unofficial appeasement.
We become inhabited by the dead,
who ruins our doomed lives. Demons in our
bodies are brutal tenants and frequently,

They suck with their vampire tongues
to drink our anemic blood 
leave their puncture marks, which
can be faintly seen on our black skins;
skins that bear greater scars,
reminders of larger, human cruelty. . .

Anyway, there isn’t a lot of life in our bodies.
We are souls. Wandering souls. Still, once
Ghost-tasted, we rot away. We rot away.
Remember, rotting is a long procedure. . .
Day by day, we grow coffin cold and slowly
Life creeps out, a lazy earthworm.
At last, we die.

We die.

The Rainy Day 

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
forest.
O child, do not go out!
The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river
is haunted by a deepening gloom.
Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence.
O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.
Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
has run away from his mother to tease her.
Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.
O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry
is closed.
The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.
The evening lamps must be made ready.
O child, do not go out!
The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is
slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
branches like a wild beast tangled in a net."
"Blood red,

Shing evily,

Silently laughing at my pain.

He enjoys it,

No...He loves it, The pain he makes others feel.

He does not speak,

But I know when I feel his eyes piercing mine, 

He is laughing inside.

I shiver in fear,

When his eyes, 

Come near.

It is true im scared,

Of his eyes and him, 

His eyes tell the things he does not.

His eyes, 

Blood red, 

Tourment me."
"Untamed
Sitting in a corner so scared and afraid,
he's standing there yelling at me,
and he's the one to blame,
Marks across my face,
From where he had hit me,
People always say that I’ve got it easy.
Bruises on my back,
The blood courses through my veins,
In this dark old room,
There is something untamed.
Scared to say a word,
Just one word to come out,
For no one knows what happens when the beast has made his rounds.
People always stare at me,
I now know what they say,
For all these scars left on my wrist,
The past has been revealed.
I do it one last time,
So no blood runs through these veins
"
"Harry, I'm Scared
 
I had always been the odd one out, in this world of people who seemed to be better than me. I could always hope that one day I would be accepted, but now a days, that hope has turned into misery.

I turned to my best friend and I said; Harry, I'm scared, I can't do it, they would hurt me if I said it.

He just looked at me and frowned and said; You need to learn to stand your ground, Teagan, you're a tough girl you're a fighter, who cares about the unwanted fire.

When Harry said unwanted fire, he meant the heated arguments between my parents.

All you need to do is be brave, and you'll be on your way. 

But I'm not brave like you Harry!

You are in your own way.

I went home that night befuddled by what Harry had said, it didn't explain anything, it made no sense in my head.

My mum saw me from outside, and came out shouting about the time of night.

Do you know what time it is? I was so worried. she would say, but it was only an act, I knew she didn't care, she continues to tell me what a waste of space I am, and that she wasted her money when she adopted me.

I don't care. I said, as I walked past her, I aimed for the door, and next thing you know, I get slapped in the face, it stings for awhile and I turn around, to see another frown.

Now listen to me, do as I say, I know what's right, and from this day, you will not stay out late, you will come home early, you are not the type of girl who wanders the street!

Me being the smart arse I am had to reply which earned me another slap and a Punch from behind.

Technically, it is not day, it is night, so your instruction means nothing what so ever, now leave me be!

Now, my story lays in the hands of the sequel of my soul, and even though you're dead now Harry, here's my message to you, Harry, I'm scared, I am sorry, but I cannot be brave, when I'm filled with worry, I know your story, but you don't know mine, but I think it's time I told you, I was adopted, I was raped, and abused, my parents hurt me in so many ways, these memories will stay with me to my dying days, Harry I miss you, I don't know what to do, I know what your would say to me now, you would say; Yep, your screwed.

I love you Harry, you will always be my best friend, no one will ever replace you, you were right, I can be brave, in my own way, by telling this short story of mine, and publishing it for the world to see, I hope your proud of me. xx

"
"Escape

Trees, trees, trees
Branches, sticks, leaves
Whipping, gashing, slashing at my arms
I can't get away no matter how fast I run

Tripping, falling, crawling on the floor
Ragged cuts, tattered clothes, jagged breathing as I start to slow
My eyes are heavy, my vision blurred
Distant images start to stir

He's right behind me, he's catching up
I have to keep moving but my legs have had enough
Getting dizzy about to pass out, a distant figure starts to stand out
A distant scream, a whispered plea, I can't believe it came from me

Pulse is racing, a feeling of hands, a gentle hush as I'm helped to stand
It's him, he's caught me, please strength don't leave me yet
Let me be anything but his sullied pet
I have to leave, I have to get away, I fall to my knees and let my head sway

Stopping he stares at me and gives a mirrored laugh
Then he reaches for me as I start to move back
I'm to slow, he's to fast, I can't get away, he's taking me back
I can't let this happen, I must react

Heads to fuzzy, I'm getting to weak
I'm stumbling over my own feet
One chance, a pull, a twist, a po+A71p and a moan
I'm not the one with a broken bone

I'm still running, he's still coming
My strength's about to give out
Dead end, cliffs end, water and rocks below
Tell me, if you had a choice which way would you go?

"Stay Strong

I have this illness
that I've suffered from for so long 
and I don't know how
but I've got to find a way to stay strong, 
I wish I could get over it really quick 
because it's making me go insane 
and it hurts when people pick
It just causes so much pain 
I just wish I could stay strong 
It really bothers me 
because I don't know what's wrong 
I'm telling myself not to cry 
but it's so hard to try 
there's got to be a way for me to stay strong 

As the days go by
I feel worse and worse 
so many things have gone wrong 
and it's just so hard to stay strong
I've got to cry 
so as the tears run down my eyes 
I realized I don't have the strength 
to stay strong


"
"Fear
I'm so tired of all the pain,
Just please let it rain,
So I can hide my tears,
So no one can see my fears,
That are going to keep haunting, 
For the rest of my life,
Just want it all to disappear,
So I don't have to deal with my fears,
Just want it all to go away,
I just hope I can be okay, 
I'm so tired of running,
I'm so sick of hiding,
All my pain is building up,
It all just hurts way too much,
I'm so tired of all the pain,
Just please let it rain,
So I can hide all my tears,
So no one can tell I am full of fear"
"It
I'm running out of breath
I can't believe its so hard to breath
My hearts pounding in my chest 
As I wonder if IT found me
I hide under the covers and pretend I'm invisible
Then I turn around and IT is still there
I scream and pray IT would just go away
I'm running and running but IT is
Right behind me 
I've been running from this thing for 5 years now
I stop running and decide to face my fears
Once and for all
As I stand face to face to what has caused me
So much misery and pain
I stop
I look deeper and deeper into IT's eyes
Than I realize that IT is me
"
"Mirror

I want you to have it all
My soul, my mistakes, my heart,
You have the key to my innermost thoughts
Slowly unlocking every door 
That shades you from me, from what I don't want you to see 
MY TRUE COLORS

Running away from you, from the one who 
relates, listens ,and appreciate me for who 
I AM
Chasing you away from my heart, willing to feel lonely
Just so you wont have a way to hurt me.
Constantly chasing you in circles never knowing were it began
and were it will end

You've unlocked everything, you've seen
my fears, my secrets, my joy,
Only one door left as you open it all you see
is a MIRROR, my biggest fear
facing fear itself, my mistakes
MYSELF"
"Im Sorry For Me
 
We have been friends for about a year,
And this is honestly my worst fear.

I'm scared of our friendship ending,
I think it is, and my heart is mending.

I'm sorry if I did something wrong,
I'm sorry if I wasn't strong.

I'm sorry that our friendship didn't work out,
But most of all, I'm sorry that I gave you doubt.

I didn't mean to be mean at all,
I didn't mean to give you a fall.

I just wanted our friendship to work out,
I didn't want you to scream and shout.

I just fear you're going to be a popular one day,
I fear that and if you do, I'm going to have to pay.

You don't know what it's like to cry yourself to sleep,
And this whole time I've really been hurting underneath.

Anyway, I just hope you see the sky not cloudy but starry,
And all I wanted to say was I'm sorry

"I Hate Poems
user img
I try to write a poem,
but poems are too hard
Rhyming is for losers
and airy-fairy bards
 
To put a pen to paper
and write about your life
I've had enough of all of those,
they only cause me strife
 
Free-verse script is awful,
for fools without a beat
Repetition's far too simple
just repeat, repeat, REPEAT
 
Those lovey-dovey ode-things,
that wishy-washy crap
And poems about hatred,
you all deserve a slap
 
Spare me all your ramblings,
I don't care how you feel
Your self-expression surely stinks
of mouldy day-old eel
 
To tell a tale of wonder
never ceases to be trite
To sing of magic wonders
is nothing but pure e
 
Your metaphors are useless,
your imagery is vile
Your sense of diction makes me gag,
I cannot stand your style
 
So save me your quotations,
please spare me all your rhyme
Shove that poem up your rear
and cease to waste my time
 
 
I look at what I've written,
this jumble of clichés
Looks like I wrote a bloody poem
so I'm the one to blame!
"
"Fear Itself Is Undefined
I lay on my bed soaking my pillow with my tears,
I try to remember exactly what it is that I fear.
Is it the passing of time or the love that I lack?
Is it the mistakes that I've made or the fact that I can't bring the past back?
What is it that I'm afraid of? 
Why am I so scared?
Is it the people I've hurt or the people that have hurt me?
Am I afraid of everything that I cant seem to see?
Is it the love of a friend, or the loss of my family?
Is it the possibility that my life can end in a tragedy? 
What is it that I fear most? 
What do my eyes say I'm scared of? 
Is it the sun that sets but won't seem to rise?
Is it the hope that I have that always seems to die?
Is it the trust of a person that I cannot begin to grasp?
Is it all the memories of my horrid past?
Is it me? 
Can it possibly be that the thing I fear most is the thing I can't be? 
The things that I try to understand? 
The me that I try to be with when I'm feeling sad? 
The person I'm expected to be? Is that what I fear? . . . 
I think the thing I fear most . . .is me"
"Last Resort

A plethora of predicaments race in my mind at best, 
which one can I fathom to ponder about next. 
Shall I even think of acting upon what my mind stirs about, 
or cry my soul asleep by this never ending drought. 
What will my career be, 
the words last resort come screaming at me with no one to yell halt. 
The quick years will pass then they will hit me and it's my own fault. 
All of my solutions come bearing a bag of infinite errors, 
my late night thoughts give me shrieking terrors. 
At what point in time does this maze come to a close. 
On the inside I am slowly weeping but on the outside I pose. 
I look around my room and it does not express myself. 
Question creeps in my eyes at the princess sign of the shelf. 
I am feeling confusion, don't worry not despair. 
All I really want in this life is to be without a care.

"He Is Here

When her mother gone, 
the little child's body feels revealed,
for the shadows speaks, you are not alone.

Close the shower curtains, cover any holes and doors; 
I am afraid he can see you even more.

He is listening to all calls, quiet, we have to be careful, what we say,
can you hear him breathing … dogs barking through the phone? He is tapping in, everyday.

Lounging in his recliner, daring any distractions in front of his screen, If you dare to cross it, there will a tree on your back, with blood easy to be seen.

So never forget, once you cross him, you will be repaid, for he will always be watching, for a mess up, to get you that day.

With our friends, he tickled or hugged,
sexually and inappropriately, why? Just because.

Jealous of the children, for his mind is like a child, needy at all times.
wanting all attention from mommy, and If not gained, for this little child, she says, pain will be mine.

Off from work he comes, releasing all anger held inside.
I am hiding in my room as a child, covered ears, as tears rolled from my eyes.

Mommy cries from the mental affects, I assured her it OK, but his voice shouted, he wanted me out of the way.

He said the boys were always a sin, for being a male, told his story from before, all were afraid of him, even for a date, was an ungodly knock at door.

In dreams, he touched, manipulated and lied, as an adult predator, in the midnight hour, mommy, please come home save me, I am telling the truth, your child not a liar.

Wanting, not grateful for all that he can get, smiling, while fake as can be,
after getting what he wants, he turns on you, stinging like a bee.

Mommy please do not let him punish in anger, with a belt in his hand firm and anchored, but let it be in love, Please Jesus, help me from above.

Never to love the children, he rather seek selfish desires, we will always be his enemies, in memory, his abuse remain ours.


"
"How Do You?

How do you tell a friend that you are worried about them?
That you think that they are not making good decisions right now.
That it scares you to see them like this.
You know that you will be there for them, but how do you make them see that?
How do you tell them so they don't get mad?
Do you tell them straight up so they deny it saying they are ok?
It's complicated no matter who you are.
It hurts to see your friends like this.
You don't want to push them away because you have a special bond.
So how do you tell someone you love, this?
There is no easy way.


"
"Me, God And The Devil

I've been tainted and shamed
Behind my pretty facade
Impured by lust and passion
Corrupted by silly illusions
My soul more broken than my heart.

No saint can save me now
I'm a sinner with no savior
So I ask God to just take me now
I want to feel numb forever
Numb, cold, and dead.

I didn't know innocence can be a sin
Accessory to evil plots
I fell against his will
Leaving me hopelessly scared, 
Trapped and good as dead.

No one knows I've got a secret
A secret I couldn't trust someone to keep
No one knows what I went through
The pain and misery I still feel
No one knows except me, God, and the devil too.


"
"The Abuse

When I was little you abused me in every way
you hurt me and didn't care because you felt no
shame.

When I was little I didn't know what you were
doing wasn't okay.


I fear the gremlins that have colonized my brain.
I fear to read the small print of the guarantee.
And what else do I fear? Let me begin again.

Us godly fear delightful unto thee,
That fear that God himself delights to see

Bear sway in them that love him? then he will
Thy godly mind in this request fulfil.

By giving thee a fear that tremble shall,
At every trip thou takest, lest thou fall,

And him offend, or hurt thyself by sin,
Or cause poor souls that always blind have been

To stumble at thy falls, and harder be
Against their own salvation and thee.

That fear that of itself would rather choose
The rod, than to offend or to abuse

In anything that blessed worthy name,
That hath thee saved from that death and shame;

That sin would soon have brought thee to, if he
Had not imputed righteousness to thee.

I will love them, saith God, and not depart
From them, but put my fear within their heart,

That I to them may always lovely be,
And that they never may depart from me.

In the empty field, in the morning,
the body waits to be claimed.
The spirit sits beside it, on a small rock--
nothing comes to give it form again.

Think of the body's loneliness.
At night pacing the sheared field,
its shadow buckled tightly around.
Such a long journey.

And already the remote, trembling lights of the village
not pausing for it as they scan the rows.
How far away they seem,
the wooden doors, the bread and milk
laid like weights on the table.

I know how father's strap would feel,
If ever I were caught,
So mother's jam I did not steal,
Though theft was in my thought.
Then turned fourteen and full of pitch,
Of love I was afraid,
And did not dare to dally with
Our pretty parlour maid.

And so it is and always was,
The path of rectitude
I've followed all my life because
The Parson said I should.
The dread of hell-fire held me straight
When I was wont to stray,
And though my guts I often hate,
I walk the narrow way.

I might have been a bandit or
A Casanovish blade,
But always I have prospered for
I've always been afraid;
Ay, fear's behind the best of us
And schools us for success,
And that is why I'm virtuous,
And happy - more or less.

So let me hail that mighty power
That goads me to be good,
And makes me cannily to cower
Amid foolhardihood;
Though I be criminal in gain,
My virtue a veneer,
I thank the God who keeps me sane,
And shields me from distress and pain,
And thrifts me on to golden gain,
Almighty Fear.

I have a fear - I may be wrong:

that all too many, put off all thoughts of 'God'
by those who claim to speak for Him,
may cease to look for, name, all wondrous things:
the good, and beautiful, and truthful; which give joy;
which you and I love as the best of life...
and name them, praise them, to our children's ears
as all the wonder that they are...

I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that even seeing this world as sweetshop of delights
we never look to see
some unity.

I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that we may miss the mind's pure joy
of stepping back to see
beyond what shows itself,
a greater and more glorious view...

I have a fear - I may be wrong:
that though we have a hazy view
of 'Creation' and 'Creator',
we do not seek to play Creation's part -
as species disappear; as world pollutes...

I have a fear -I may be wrong:
we know the words; but miss the song.

Don’t be afraid of fear
Because fear is afraid of itself
You give into fear when you doubt yourself
Fear makes you a complete opposite of yourself
Draining every bit of confidence your body has left
Fear tricks you of your potential
Wiping away your credentials
A life ruled by fear is life without hope
Of course people are going to have raining days
But with fear, everyday you will have your droughts

Be confident and put your head up high
How can fear overtake you when you’re looking at the
Beautiful clouds high in the sky

I was a grovelling creature once,
And basely cleaved to earth:
I wanted spirit to renounce
The clod that gave me birth.

But God hath breathed upon a worm,
And sent me from above
Wings such as clothe an angel's form,
The wings of joy and love.

With these to Pisgah's top I fly
And there delighted stand,
To view, beneath a shining sky,
The spacious promised land.

The Lord of all the vast domain
Has promised it to me,
The length and breadth of all the plain
As far as faith can see.

How glorious is my privilege!
To Thee for help I call;
I stand upon a mountain's edge,
O save me, lest I fall!

Though much exalted in the Lord,
My strength is not my own;
Then let me tremble at His word,
And none shall cast me down.

Powerful, that’s right,
I’m a terror, as you will see, no one can beat me.
Why I’ll tear you apart from top to bottom.
I won’t give a damn, winter, spring, summer or autumn.
If you cross me, I’ll mow you down
like a huge caterpillar machine right to the ground.
I’m bigger than life, full of horror and strife.
I’ll take all you’ve got, even your life.
Friends-no, not your mother
your father, nor your sister or brother.
Strong, powerful, big and fearless.
Your worst enemy, listen and hear this,
be alert, drug free, your mind must be clear
or you’ll be dealing with me out there.
I don’t care about your friends or your loving family.
I’ve been known to bring death to those who mock me.
So pick up your socks and take heed, or those
you love will fall in need.
I’m here, there and everywhere.
Don’t worry, prejudice you will not find.
I want all, young, old, rich, poor.
You can all come screaming through my door.
I’ve killed more people than you can imagine.
so c’mon working class, learn your trade,
be the best that you can be, and take top grades.
For those who excel, will certainly exceed.
Never become victim to my selfish greed.

They call me
“CARELESSNESS”

This is dedicated to my son 'John' and all men and women
who drive big machinery or big rigs.

Though better men may fear that trumpet's warning,
I meet you, lady, on the Judgment morning,
With golden hope my spirit still adorning.

Our God who made you all so fair and sweet
Is three times gentle, and before his feet
Rejoicing I shall say:—"The girl you gave
Was my first Heaven, an angel bent to save.
Oh, God, her maker, if my ingrate breath
Is worth this rescue from the Second Death,
Perhaps her dear proud eyes grow gentler too
That scorned my graceless years and trophies few.

Gone are those years, and gone ill-deeds that turned
Her sacred beauty from my songs that burned.
We now as comrades through the stars may take
The rich and arduous quests I did forsake.
Grant me a seraph-guide to thread the throng
And quickly find that woman-soul so strong.
I dream that in her deeply-hidden heart
Hurt love lived on, though we were apart,
A brooding secret mercy like your own
That blooms to-day to vindicate your throne.

Is blind fear blind?
Yes, it is
Is blind fear fear?
Yes, it is

Can blind fear see?
No, it can't
Can blind fear destroy?
Yes, it can

The wind was strong and the dust blew viciously.
Walking on a dirt road, not sure of my destination.
I encountered a coyote standing in the distance. My
first thought was to turn and run and then I
realized that might not be a good idea. I slowly
walked, placing one foot quietly in front of the
other, while keeping my eye on the coyote. The
animal did not move, it stood in the same position.
Fearful as I was, I didn’t want the animal to know
my fear. I bravely took step after step and walked
toward the road. Finally I reached a crossing in
the road. When I turned to look back the coyote
was gone. At that point, I felt sure I was safe and
continued to walk down the road. When I
approached an old shack at the road clearing, I
noticed paw prints on the soft ground. Immediately
I thought, what animal made those prints, surely
it wasn’t the coyote that I encountered earlier,
certainly not, don’t be silly I thought to myself.
Once again I continued to walk forward. I could
feel butterflies in my stomach. What were those
prints on the ground. Trying not to think about it,
I began to walk faster and faster. Suddenly I
heard a noise, it sounded like a scratching noise
behind me. Oh what now, could that be the
coyote. My heart was racing and the sweat
poured down my face causing my eyes to sting.
My vision blurred by my perspiration, I was beside
myself and was feeling very sick to my stomach.
Never before, have I been so afraid, never so unsure
of myself. I wanted to run, but once again
wondered if the animal that was following me
might run and attack me.

To His Heart, Bidding It Have No Fear
BE you still, be you still, trembling heart;
Remember the wisdom out of the old days:
Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,
And the winds that blow through the starry ways,
Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood
Cover over and hide, for he has no part
With the lonely, majestical multitude.

There's primal fear like a fetus blinded by daylight
There's lingering fear like a zit growing on your nose
There's groundless fear like a dark day covered by a clear night
There's inarticulate fear like a little fish wolfed down by a shark
There's sudden fear like a demon startled by an unfamiliar ghost
There's mortal fear like a soul baffled by heavenly hell
There's fake fear like a popstar blowing his/her lines
There's undying fear like boomerang returning to hit you hard
There's cryptic fear like a stranger ringing at your doorbell
There's fatal fear like falling prey to a predator
There's introverted fear we've invented by ourselves
And have to live with it.

I DO not fear to own me kin
To the glad clods in which spring flowers begin;
Or to my brothers, the great trees,
That speak with pleasant voices in the breeze,
Loud talkers with the winds that pass;
Or to my sister, the deep grass.

Of such I am, of such my body is,
That thrills to reach its lips to kiss.
That gives and takes with wind and sun and rain
And feels keen pleasure to the point of pain.

Of such are these,
The brotherhood of stalwart trees,
The humble family of flowers,
That make a light of shadowy bowers
Or star the edges of the bent:
They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent;
They joy to shed themselves abroad;
And tree and flower and grass and sod
Thrill and leap and live and sing
With silent voices in the Spring.

Hence I not fear to yield my breath,
Since all is still unchanged by death;
Since in some pleasant valley I may be,
Clod beside clod, or tree by tree,
Long ages hence, with her I love this hour;
And feel a lively joy to share
With her the sun and rain and air,
To taste her quiet neighbourhood
As the dumb things of field and wood,
The clod, the tree, and starry flower,
Alone of all things have the power.

I fear not of tomorrow
The dark scares me not
I am not full of sorrow
Although I've weeped a lot

What I fear is not on paper
There are no words big enough
I am not a hater
Although this world can be so tough

What I fear is much deeper
It is not simply cold or hot
What makes me a weeper
Is the fear of loosing all I've got

It's the fear of fear itself
That keeps me up at night
The fear of fear itself
Is what keeps happiness out of my sight

It's the fear of putting all plans on the shelf
That makes me afraid of loosing my very self

The fear of scaring away
Who I am inside
Is what makes me
So afraid I hide

I come now from those foreign places
Unknown to those with hidden faces
Bedecked and different, for them to leer
As one unknown, something to fear

Am I not I that you can see?
What is the fear you see in me?
This faceless one, that makes you quake
I hold no fear its what you make

mpting me to punch stringently with my rock hard palms,
into the supple core of his solar plexus,
evacuating tons of air trapped in his flatulent belly,
annihilating forever the ostentation he displayed in ridiculing the youth of my age.







we should teach our children gifts
beauty wisdom insight healing caring
discernment to disarm angry souls







Free the birds, let them go to the East
The North is unfavourable to them;
The terrorists has done them wrong
Feasting from where they have not sown.
The overwhelmed corpses on the ground
Has becomes the object of their pains.

Free the angry birds to their songs
Are aching our innocent fearful ears;
Let the birds sing to the air of their pains,
Maybe their tone could be heard and be of
help the casualities
We have listened and our ears are worn out
To their sagging songs.

Allow the birds to march to the Eagle's square,
Their plight could be heard in the midst of the house
In the morning of their quest to see the change,
The Boo Harries seek selfishly without consideration.
Try to maintain the tempo of their sagging voice
And make the note known abroad where
Emotions and feelings are not morally abused.

Mount the speakers outside the Eagle's square and let them sing to the Boo Harries of our economy,
Master the beat of their melody for the
Beauty of their agony lies in the lyrics of their songs.
I have seen them lately at the corner whispering,
Lingered words to the cloud of the suffering which
The Boo Harries have pushed them into.
Free the angry birds to tell the world their plight.







I had to stop being angry.
And displaying bitterness,
Because of my own disappointments...
Others may have.
But I would carry mine,
On my shoulders as if...
The World weighed me down.
And I thought I should be burdened,
By collecting pieces of bricks and chips...
Thrown around me I grew tired to witness.

Too many today seem to pride themselves,
With complaints to make and fingers to point.
I began to think it was my mission and duty,
To be the one to join in to prove I could too...
Find my own life to live as an excuse to choose.

I had to stop being angry.
And displaying bitterness,
Because of my own disappointments...
Others may have.
But I would carry mine,
On my shoulders as if...
The World weighed me down.
And I thought I should be burdened,
By collecting pieces of bricks and chips...
Thrown around me I grew tired to witness.

And then it occurred to me,
When I awakened early one morning...
Before the light of dawn,
To hit my head against an open door...
That I had been doing most of my life,
With eyes I decided to keep close.
To take so much for granted.
And it took a door I ignored,
To show me to pay more attention...
To which direction I was going,
Where I was coming from...and why...
The doing of it was more important,
Than what others had chosen for themselves.
And...
With it done to do as 'their' purpose.






301.Where your anger wreaks havoc, there you’d restrain it.
Elsewhere what does it matter if you check it or not?
302.Being angry, where your anger works not, is harmful.
More harmful than anything else, where it works.
303.Who he may be, forget your ire against him;
As anger begets all evils.
304.Wrath kills smiles of face and delights of heart.
Is there anything more lethal than anger to one?
305.If one wants to shield oneself, shield against ire.
Or else the ire kills the one who breeds it.
306.The fire of ire destroys your near and dear ones.
And it will burn the protecting raft of your kinsmen.
307.One who nurses anger as something of some merit
Moans in pain as one who strikes at the earth.
308.Though one does harm you like stinging tongues of fire,
It is good to you not to feel anger against one.
309.If one doesn’t think of raging fires in one’s mind
One will get all the things, one’s heart desires.
310.Men of raging wrath are dead alike.
Men who renounce wrath are like sages.







Sir Vidya, you in the goggles
Looking like a star,
A superstar,
Really a hero,
O, Trinidadian writer,
Mimic Man!

Are you not the angry
Old man of literature,
The angry old man,
Aren't you V.S.Naipaul?







The wind loves the river
In noon time in expressive ways
Laughs the river, way of sweet waves
The happiness everyone sees
A boatman tries to cross the river
The river tells him
Man you are making troubles between us
My friend and me talking each other
Why you disturb in such a time
See I can capsize your boat now itself
Or leave here at the earliest
My patience take it for granted.







Angry devil got no goodness!
His business is to mislead humans! !
He even possessed Bush and Blair!
To do things unkind and unfair! ! !






YOU HAVE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY WITH ME
You have right to be angry with me
An essence of me, indeed it is you.
You belong to no one, but to me
Light of my life, believe me it is you.

The heaven has right to wrap blue ocean
Bees have right to suck flower-sweetness.
Life has right over your own motion
The charity has right over its greatness.

Your face turns bright and red with anger
It is incredible sight like golden dawn
I preserve it as joyful moment of temper
My love dissolves deep inside your bone.






The Master, The Rabbi, the Guru,
was the most accepting man
on the planet,
non-judgmental
unconditional lover
of all.
But what would bring up anger
would be the money changers
the bankers
and how
they did business.
If Jesus entered his Earth Temple
today, what would he think
of the money handlers of the world?






Greedy, angry
And deceitful.
Who is he?
He is a man.
It is only a man,
Who can adopt
Foul means of
Livelihood.
It is only a man,
Who can worship
Both black and white
At the same time.
Come on man and
Remove your ignorance.






Angry

Anger taking over common-sense,
Negativity and darkness taking over,
Generating hostility and hatred,
Reasoning lost and a world falling apart,
Yet we've survived this long despite anger.

By Christopher Tye






Have you ever felt yourself as useless
Four times now I've used this Greatness in Tragedy line to get my own point across
No more I can't take it, can't take it no more
But even that line is stolen, taken, used before by Three Days Grace
I could ponder why voices are stronger than mine
Then I'd have to wonder so strongly and unforgivingly why I'm so insignificant in my very own life
It's like I'm in an anthill, my life at a standstill, water on the window sill
Hardly noticeable, easy to forget
Why am I being so irrefutably replaced
Replaced, replaceable
Is that my role in my life
I can't succeed at one simple thing so yeah out the door, here someone can succeed where you fail
But no here you go, a consolation prize
A small list of what you do right
But it's not just this one night
It's from every fight, every light gone dark
Every sad day, bad day, ugly day, terrible day
When rage boils like the waves on the coast during a hurricane
Here I am insufficient, suffering from malfunction
And in my panic can only quote lyrics I assume would calm growing storms
Would soothe raging heartbeats but am just met with 'see you later'
An ever increasing silent destroyer of my self esteem
And at the seams, I would only like to vanish
Play the part of eating a disintegrator
So my very molecules can dissipate
Have my particles dance like a floating dandelions blissfully in the air
Don't count me so melancholy nor suicidal
Don't count me a label unjustified
I am angry
At the world, at myself, at anything and nothing
This is a never ending cycle where when I am productive in my own sense, on my own terms
I am achieving, one step closer to the goals I've set for myself; set for my life
Yet I want to blame someone, be mad at something
For I dont see success, I see misery
I don't see my cup overflowing, I see my lips pressed to the glass still asking for a refill
I don't see the sun, I see the moon
In all of daylight's unreachable beauty, I still search the sky for the moon so he doesn't feel as lonely as I do
But no one could feel as lonely as me
Surrounded by over three hundred faces everyday
Some I recognize, some that stay hidden among a sea of unfamiliarity
And still in company, I still find myself face deep in my hands
More worried about grabbing a few winks than a few blinks in my direction
I don't care for eye contact, people misunderstand the way I stare anyway
Shroud me in shadow, I don't exist unless spoken to anyway
Philosophers, astronomers, any other intellectual furiously curious minds alike
Tell me why we can see only through our eyes
Yet still know nothing at all
Know our own faults, our own laws, our own paws, our own claws
Yet exist as nothing at all

 pooper scooper.
A port a potty for our four legged friends
on every street corner where every road bends.
Then I'll become famous for this awesome invention
at the monthly town meetings my name will be mentioned.
They'll throw a big party and dance in the streets
because never again will there be poop on our feet!



After The Operation

So now he has had his eyes done, 
and at last he can see,

but I was a bit worried, 
what would he think of me?

You see, he hadn't seen me, 
out of two good eyes,

would I be a total shock, 
or a nice surprise?

He said my God, you are almost grey, 
you're eyes are much too small,

you are old and fat and ugly,
I'm not impressed at all

But as I sat there crying, 
I suddenly noticed that---

he wasn't looking my way,
but talking to the cat!!

so yes I think he's very pleased 
with all that he can see

He thinks every thing is lovely, 
and that includes me!!



Smarter Than Him

I locked my brother in a closet
T’see what he would do.
And jus' before I think he lost it,
He thoughta something new:

Ha-ha! he saidI thought, Oh, dear
You know, I think I got it!
I’m not locked insida here,
I locked you outta the closet!

Nuh-uh! I said; he disagreed,
So I opened the door on a whim
To prove, before he made me bleed,
That I was smarta than him



Picture Perfect

She stood there by the ocean,
The breeze gently lifted her hair.
Of that seagull just above her,
She was totally unaware.

Seemingly floating in the sky,
The seagull’s wings were still.
I think it paused to take good aim,
And drop a mess at will.

Too late she looked above her head,
Where the seagull hovered now.
Then as I watched in horror,
Bird droppings hit her brow.

Her scream pierced the balmy air.
Splat! The stuff hit her face.
Then she saw my camera and me,
And stomped off in disgrace.



Monkey In The Middle

There once was a monkey in a city’s zoo,
who dreamed of the outside sun.
He did like hitting kids with poo,
but he felt that that’s been done.

So he climbed out in the middle of night, 
and explored through the cities streets.
He stopped when it was turning light 
And felt he wanted to eat.

That poor monkey needed cash 
to afford his exotic meals.
But his stomach led him to the trash,
where he ate a cube of butter and apple peels.

If he wanted to eat, he needed a job,
to pay for the food on his tummy.
So he asked many snobs,
but each time he left without money.

He tried to be an actor,
but found out he couldn't sing or cry.
He had the smarts to be a politician,
but found out he couldn't lie.

None one wanted his application.
No one gave him a chance.
Some were scared because he was from another nation.
Other because he didn’t own pants.

He only found one job, 
that paid food and shelter instead of wages.
All he was asked to do,
was to sit inside steel cages,
and dream of the outside sun.



Little Birdy

I saw a little bird today 
sitting perched next to my bed
she was singing such a pretty song
I was thinking in my head
so I sat and listened for a while
calm as can be and quite still
till she flew away and perched 
up on my sill

She continued singing a different song
louder than before
curiously I watched her 
and started to get bored
I thought to myself I am tired still
and want to go to bed
so I took my pillow sleepily 
and covered up my head

I waited a while and removed the pillow till
I saw she was still perched on my window sill
I started to turn red
I got up to slam the window closed
and turned to go to bed 
When I saw what I had done 
the little bird was dead

Where there was triumph and happiness 
guilt was replaced instead 
for in my eagerness to go to sleep 
I crushed her little head



A Dieter's Despair

Oh my soul, be thou quiet
This is not 'another diet'
Just a program of exchange
Though some things do seem strange

Raw vegetables and 'brock-o-lee'
Does not sound too good to me
Lots of tofu and bean sprouts
While my empty stomach shouts

The meaning here is quite plain;
This program is designed for pain
Someone with anorexia planned
A program that tastes like sand

My hands are sweating, my soul is dreading
I must keep this thing from spreading
My only hope, the paper shredder
It finally made this diet better



The Greatest Accessory Of Them All

People care to much.
How their hair looks
or their clothes.
They don't care about what matters
The soul

The soul is what truly matters
that thing that is deep inside.
The soul is always fashionable 
no matter what the season is.

The soul is something that changes color a million times
from when you are born to when you die.
My soul is yellow today 
because I'm happy inside.

On Thursday my soul was green
for I envied another girl.

The soul is by far the best accessory you can have.
And that's what they should write in the magazines.



What A Life!

I once applied for a life online
Sadly however, I was declined
They told me I was not eligible
So I wrote them a letter to complain
They sent it back, it was not legible
So on with my search for a life
This has given me a bit of strife
I don't have enough money or any good looks
I can't paint a picture or write a book
I can barley chew gum and walk at the same time
I can even be quiet enough to become a mime
I once asked a professor where to find one
He directed me straight to an insane Asylum
I can't play the drums or even a fife
I guess I'll have to re-apply, What a Life!



A Boy Named Sue

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die. Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong.

Yeah, he said, Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue.
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue.



Messy Room

Whosever room this is should be ashamed!
His underwear is hanging on the lamp.
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,
And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.
His workbook is wedged in the window,
His sweater's been thrown on the floor.
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.
His books are all jammed in the closet,
His vest has been left in the hall.
A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,
And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.
Whosever room this is should be ashamed!
Donald or Robert or Willie or--
Huh? You say it's mine? Oh, dear,
I knew it looked familiar!



The Tyger

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?




'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyeshow they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight
Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!


ce I’m slipping away
Do you notice the scars on my arms
I’m going crazy stuff just so you will notice me
But the thing is I just want my mom back
I want my best friend
I just want to go back 
Where I told you everything
Is that possible
All the tears I’ve cried
I just want my mom back!



Listen Up

Mom will you sit down 
To listen what I have to say 
We can be in the same room
And be miles and miles away
We are not a happy family anymore
Do you think you fix this
You can’t be
Cause you are never home
Do you still remember my face
Do you think a father figure will help
It won’t I already have one
I don’t want another
You can marry a million guys
We still won’t be a happy family
Do you notice I’m slipping away
Do you notice the scars on my arms
I’m going crazy stuff just so you will notice me
But the thing is I just want my mom back
I want my best friend
I just want to go back 
Where I told you everything
Is that possible
All the tears I’ve cried
I just want my mom back!



A Smile

A smile is just a Gesture,
That's made on one's face,
What if the knew,
All I needed was space?
I NEED to breathe,
NEED to get away,
Don't know how much longer,
I am here to stay.
We had such fun,
Used to laugh all day.
You said you wouldn't leave,
You said you would stay.
But know you are gone,
And I must force a smile,
Because you had told me,
It was just for a while.
Now we are leaving,
Leaving all our pasts here.
Ditching the friends and the family,
That have grown so dear.
You tell me to be happy,
To have fun for a while,
But how can I have fun,
When I can't find a smile?



I Guess It Didn't

I know I should 
I wish I could
Just let you know 
What must not show 
Another life 
That is filled with strife

I said no
but I guess what I meant did't really show
he drugged me 
then hugged me
and after that he stripped me of my dignity
and stripped me of my confidence

I know I should
I wish I could
Just let you know 
what must not show 
another life
That is filled with strife

I said no 
But I guess what I meant didn't really show
that when a girl says no
she really means no



The Ghost

The ghost that hunts, but hasn't died.
He left after only a short time.
Never wrote or so I thought.
Years pass and something tore him a part.
I've always thought something wasn't right.
She tells me my father isn't who I love.
My little mind only cries.
My little mind only hates.
He left and never saw all the wondrous things that I've done.
The ghost that hunts, but never died.
I haven't heard a word in a long time.
I'm sweet sixteen, but without the sweetness.
For the past eight or nine years on my birthdays before I blow out the candles, I wish for his presence to join the room.
Or maybe later to see him in a dream.
I pray constantly for God to bring him back to me.
I see my friends with both their mommy's and daddy's.
I wonder maybe that could be me.
Jealously isn't a pretty thing and I wish not to be.
I tell them love for what you have, because the someone unfortunately doesn’t have a dad.
The ghost that haunts, but still lives.
Will you HELP ME FIND MY DAD!



Not Letting You Go

Grip my hand
Don’t ever let go,
Just give me one more chance
To let you know,
I didn’t mean what I said
And I never thought you’d be here,
In an hospital bed,
Lying cold, numb, almost dead,
And I can't take it,
Please pull through I know you can make it,
Don’t leave me here
Make me shed this tear
You’re all I’ve got,
Even if I appreciated it or not,
You’ve always been there,
Near or far apart,
Even though I didn’t realize,
You were in my heart,
And I know you’re strong
And to this fate you don’t belong,
I need you here to comfort me,
I need to you to fight,
Don’t shut your eyes,
Don’t fall into the light,
Because if you go, my world will fall apart,
And I’ll have a broken heart,
And now as you lie here I know,
I’ve always needed you,
Right from the very start,
And I’m not letting you go.



The Pain Shows

When I look into your eyes, 
I see the pain you try to hide.
You try to be tough, 
But the pain shows 
The hurting, 
And the suffering that this is causing you
The pain shows
Although you act as if nothing is wrong, 
The pain shows
You try to be brave
But the pain shows
You try to hide the tears
But the pain shows
Who knew looking into your eyes would reveal so much pain



Does My Daddy Love Me?

Does my daddy love me when he doesn't talk to me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn’t spend time with me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn't make me feel special?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn’t call me see how I'm doing?
Does my daddy love me when he hasn't been to my birthday in 7 years?
Dose my daddy love me? 
Really? If so, how come he doesn't show it?



I'm A Sad Fairy

She is very beautiful 
one of a kind
she's normal and simple
but she's hard to find
she holds her anger in
but she dreams of fantasy's
she commits many sin's
but seeks a true destiny
she has beautiful long brown hair
she lets it down at night
she's in the starry sky and everywhere
her presents makes light
I see her in the mirror
but in her eyes she holds fear



Bravado

alone again, 
just another day dedicated to love ones missed. 
As I sit with an empty soul, 
not sad, 
not glad but pissed, 
thinking back on happier times 
when those who are gone hugged and kissed. 
But they're gone and the world still turns. 
I put up a bravado that I'm happy, 
but really my heart yearns for those better days 
trips to the beach and sun burns. 
Family get-togethers 
laughs and smile. 
Food collecting on our plates in piles and piles. 
But now all that piles up on my tears, 
most out of heartache but some come from fears. 
I could have hydrated an entire nation over the years. 
Yet I mask them with smiles that are hollow 
in hope that there will always be a better tomorrow. 
But until then you will forever see is my bravado.



Daughter Taken By Mothers Lies

Have you any clue ?
To the pain
You have put
Me through ?
Pain so deep
With in me.
That at night
When I finally
Close my eye's
To sleep
I can hear
My 
SOUL
WEEP !



Involuntary Acceptance

Even though
We’re far apart
You’ll always be
In our heart

He loved you then
We love you now
Kept from your life
We don’t know how

Perhaps one day
A chance we’ll be given
Until that time
You’ll be missed where we’re liven

We’ll hope for the best
But expect the worst
That you’ll change your mind
For this we’ll thirst

Whether you do or don’t
We may never know
But never forget
We still love you so



Victim Of Poverty

Poverty stricken youth jus trying to make a buck
mom working two jobs and pops don't give a fk

daddy never comes around 
at night the only sound

that can be heard are the sounds of the ghetto
drug dealing, gang banging the sirens of the po po

he finds himself posted on the corner slangin dope
to him it seems like the only hope

to finally get off the block or stay at a dead end job wit no raise
so on the corner he stays

high school dropout wit no time for class
time at a desk could be spent in the spot making cash

scarface dreams are clouding up his mind
cocaine sales taking up his time

greed has polluted his brain, spirit, and soul
hatred and a heart as black as coal

have takin over him what is he to do
no one gives him an answer looking for a clue

looking to the sky for some kind of sign
all he can see is a life full of crime

until the day the cops get him or his enemies catch him in the wrong hood
wearin the wrong colors, throwin up the wrong signs if he could

change things he'd do anything for a second chance
times up he has a dance

with the devil that's going to last an eternity
another soul lost, but others see it as another victim of poverty.



Rain

I sit and watch
as the rain falls 
from a sky so dark and gray

Is this life
a crying sky
if so,
not even I can fight

I'm tired of hurting
I'm tired of tears
I'm tired of being alone
for all these years

I want peace
and I want love
I want to break free
to fly above!



The Face Of Sadness

Its happened again.

The moment when I thought nothing would go wrong,
That everything would be alright,
That there was nothing to worry about,
That everything was perfect.

But just like those other times,
It didn't last.
Another moment in life,
Another piece to the puzzle.
Slowly completing,

And showing its face.

The face that I've been longing to see.
The face I was always aware of,
The face I've been waiting for,
The face I'm conscious of.

Suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.

I stare motionless,
Although expected, still surprised.
Calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,
Able to realize that this is what I was sent to discover.
Sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.

Not a game but another rationally humanly way of living.
Just another part I must adjust to.
And when the end suddenly appears,
Ill be proud to say that I learned something in life.
Proud to say that I learned something thanks to you.

Proud to say I saw the face and learned about it.

Proud to say that that face was introduced by you,
Fed by you,
And lived by you.


tual sense she was not.
A man came to her and starred at her glancifully
Without saying anything to her in the first minute.
She thought in her mind;
The angel of God has appeared to her
She opened up her large eyes so wide
So as to see that man clearly.

The man approached the lady and said hi.
She replied with a nervous answer for the
Way he greeted her it was so informal.
She wondered who that man was!

Minutes passed, hours and then almost a day
For them as they poured out their spirits to
One another and its like they have known
Each other for ages rather just a day.

They spent the entire day talking about themselves
Without feeling hungry or tired.
It was what nature had prepared for them
Love that has never been felt before on the first day.

Darkness crawled around them
They switched on the lights and the full
Moon shown so bright over them
As they sat on the lawn outside the house.

The breeze was so blissful
That they felt like it was right for them
To go on to another level of their first meeting.
Their inner spirits longed for each other,

Till at last the man reached out to the lady
And said, 'Will you marry me? '
The lady mesmerized and amazed
With what he said and how he said that phrase

Got her turned on and she never hesitated
In replying; 'Yes I will! ' for she felt he was
The one meant for her and that he's
The one God had sent to end her misery.

“Had a peevish dream
about a piece of meat.
Rotting in steaming heat.
Stone cold end edicts one
stiff statuette shocked
viewer dreamer numb.

It proved tragically. To be me.
I’m decapitated dead you see.
Life’s not so desperately bad.

Meanings not so ultimately sad.”
Overwhelming urgent anxiety
overcome at point of lasting hope.


Dramatic not reckless was last resort
beyond hope wicked defeated by grace
in redemption deed. Beauty generosity

of spirit an infinite love favour mercy;
the goodwill shown to humankind by God
rebukes sin in martyrs crown. After all!

Life may take us by surprise
Happy it may be or sad,
Attitude's what helps us rise
When life circumstance is bad.

In sickness there's always hope
That tomorrow may bring health,
In poverty's far tightened rope
Dreams of future with much wealth.

If children hurt and leave you
After labor for their good,
Send upward prayers in lieu
Of broken hearts and fired wood.

Friends may deeply let us down
With words that stab the guts,
Pick the pieces do not frown
Heal the wounds and mend the cuts.

Losing loved ones; death so brings
Grief and sadness take control,
Future hope of heaven sings
Life gets better; let time roll.

Life will take us by surprise
Are we ready to respond?
Let hope for tomorrow rise;
Daily living with much fond.

I loved him and him me;
Unexplained it was
Everyone knew it, and I liked it that way
It was exclusive; every passing day.
Save for the surprise…

He opened my eyes to the world
For he taught me;
How to receive the best and the worst;
That to be happy you have to forgive fast
But then, he had a surprise…

This man, he was perfect, in his way.
Matters kindness, his life was an example
Our love grew; days to years,
His strength; Oh, I had no fears.
In love, only not filled in for the surprise…

Things started to change, they always do
Another vector life took; and this man,
He gave in. I still don’t understand
How my warrior gave in. such a painful stunt;
And I, had to conform to the surprise…

“Keep on keeping on;
Life is tough, but you are the best.”
Well, my wish is that this saying
Could only be affirmed before your parting
I’m sad. For death was the paining surprise.

Had a peevish dream
about a piece of meat.
Rotting in steaming heat.
Stone cold end edicts one
stiff statuette shocked
viewer dreamer numb.


It proved tragically. To be me.
I’m decapitated dead you see.
Life’s not so desperately bad.
Meanings not so ultimately sad.

Gather your wealth riches on dust earth
with insatiable greed as much as you
can; as you like in your mammon worship.
Heavenly hope is your myth rejection.

God of this system of things is your God after all!

The problem facing many men
and women, even nations,
when suffering is that that is when
they most require patience,
but nations, men and women, too,
too often find it rougher
to take a cool and patient view
than patiently and calm to suffer,
for everyone, yes, even nations,
must sometimes tough it out
and has to learn that no impatience
can put deep grief to rout.
Indeed, the whole world should remember,
impatience rarely pays;
fall comes when it will come, September
relieves hot summer days,
and spring will follow winter’s storm
with patience, when surprise,
the welcome element, will warm
the patient heart and eyes.

His face was the face of an angel
A bear angel at least I can say
Big paws to catch fish with
He looked quite ready for play

But of course, the bears were avoided
By the animals that lived in the barn
Probably some could tell you
Some sort of bear-scary yarn

Badgers of course would never
Spend time with bears for sure
Turkeys are ever so fearful
Bears they could never endure

But bear country Is a place I have seen
Bears just as cute as could be
I saw a baby bear climb up
To the top of a very small tree

I just love everything about them
Although you surely must be wise
For they are still wild animals
And you don’t need a bear surprise!

It was a surprise to discover…
You took a breath to recover.
Yes, we were expecting an addition.
There seemed to be some opposition.

This is something we can’t afford.
This is a big burden, not a reward.
It will be difficult with smaller portions.
I am asking, will you consider abortion?

As a loving mother, this could not be my choice.
For this life within me, I gave a strong voice.
We will manage somehow. I know it in my heart.
This child is a part of me; it shall not depart.

The child was born; she was a beautiful baby girl.
She makes me proud; she has the luster of a pearl.
Her dad bestows recognition… when he’s around.
He gave her away the day she wore a wedding gown.

It was a morning like all the others,
triste, weather cloudy, cold and blah,
nothing on that stupid telly or the radio,
no selection in the blasted fridge,
neighbour's kids all fighting and the cats
maintaining territory through their bloody screams,
the tax collector left his pink collection
the puppy messed the covers of my bed,
that tiny drip straight from the attic now is big,
unfinished mail piled up on two disordered desks
the pension application's deadline was last week,
two ingrown toenails hurt with every single step.

And, we who always did consider we were lucky,
to be inhabiting a sandy coral island,
are writing this from castles in the sky now.
It was the Great Tsunami. Came and saved the day.

After the March winds
we have the April rain.
Now in May we watch
the pretty flows grow.
June, July and August
are the flowering seasons
at the height of the noonday’s sun.
September brings the autumn leaves
near the closing of the year.
October seems to bear all
as the autumn leaves begin to fall.
November brings a chill
to every living thing
announcing winter is on its way.
December’s snow blankets
the hard frozen ground.
January brings in a new year
to February’s valentines.
And so each moth rolls by,
each greeting us with a new surprise.

Iran rebels, will sell crude outside “Cartel”
Over low barrel price, Bush doth agonize
Readies to loose his “War dogs from hell”
So in late 2008 expect “October surprise”

the Japanese says
he's surprised I use
chopsticks too

I thought everybody knows Chopsticks orgiinated in China and spread around from there. So I was very surprised when several Japanese expressed surprise that I can use chopsticks. Perhaps, they are not well versed in the history of chopsticks.


ever came. instead she watches him leave as quietly as he came.
the footsteps the door the light all clear in her mind.
the thing that keeps her here sane on this earth is counting the footsteps.
if only it was the once.
if only it was over.
but its never over.
why cant she stop it.
why dosent she brake.
maybe she tried.
she needs saving from herself
to much pressure for anyone to take
no one wants to hear it
its out of the norm
so shes back into the silence.
waiting, hoping it wont be the same.


never fear fear
it is not that bad
you have to over come it
or you will fear it forever

Death can arrive any moment
It needs no invitation
The old must go first
Not likely
Why care?
It is better not to think of it
Thinking about it makes you fearful,
just a hindering.

I stare outside my window
In the thinning light
There are long streaks of shadow
The sun has lost its bright

The birds are flying home
Making a kaleidoscope of sound
I listen to the whispering dome
And see the fog rise from the ground

As it snakes its way up
Engulfing one and all
The distant lights look eerie
Strange shapes on the wall

I strain my ears to hear
As the birds form a black line
Is there a sound in the silence?
I feel a chill crawling up my spine

The distant mountain is fading
The shadows all but gone
I hear a distinct wailing
Is it the wind whistling on?

I feel the cold air in my face
As a door far away falls
I want to move away
But my legs refuse my calls

I hear footstep approach
They stop outside my door
I am frozen with sweat on my back
Is something crawling on the floor

At that moment I am reminded
Of a saying that was my recent find
We have nothing to fear but fear
As it play games with our mind

I took your hand and hold it tight
I don't want you out of my sight
When in darkness you gave me light
And it is coz of love, you fight.

In times of these I need to be strong
And you'll be staying there for how long?
Waiting for you my tears are prolonged
But it's in your side where I belong.

I close my eyes and saw you smile
Can we just stay here for a while?
I tried to reach you in a mile
But you just stand the with your smile.

I open my eyes, with fear I face life
While you befriended fear and face death
Reality stabs me with a sharp knife
Can't we just go back to the time we met?

Farewell to the sight of you my dear
But neither to your voice I still hear
Nor to your love tha'll always be here
Thanks, with your love there's nothing I fear.

Fear can grip us in a cruel way,

In times of joy, and in time of sorrow,
Leaving us with the fear of tomorrow,

Is it going away or has it come to stay,

Has it come to hunt us as its prey?

When fear comes close and becomes our foe,

God will be here don’t you know?

Even when it ruins your day,

We must not start to worry and fear,

We must pray and trust,

For God is always here, to wipe away each tear,

We must face our fear, we must!

God will certainly help us, he has made that clear,

Our God is faithful and just!

There is a saying
'Dont Fear Anything But Fear Itself'
But that has no affect
on someone who rejects
without regret
People dont understand
so why should we take
a lending hand
that would be a mistake
for that person is full of themselves
or so it seems
they dont want to blend
but want to gleam
having control of your own
its all you
of wut u want to do
what u think and like
what u say and who u talk about
but u didnt want to hear
you gave that person another reason to fear
so why should we talk
when we know that person has just walked
walked away without listening
not knowing that they took that person's
glistening
smile of joy and peace
but at least
u said something at all
playin in there mind like a ball
but u didnt want to hear
you just gave that person another reason to fear
you being here
not wanting to listen
you took that person's glistening
smile of peace and joy
playin with their mind like it is a toy
not caring how they felt
while whipping them with a belt
a belt of betrayal and hate
but its too late
you didnt want to here
you gave that person another reason to be afraid:
the fear of fear

I fear to lose my mind,
To stay perfectly still and never find.
What will save me,
I need the key.
To unlock the door,
To keep my feet firmly on the floor.
And not keep my feet on the ceiling,
Not to know what it is I'm feeling.
An empty shell,
Could spell.
The end.

I Fear to lose my soul,
To spiral down and out of control.
To slip away,
A little bit more everyday.
Till there's nothing left,
No socks, no vest.
For my soul to wear,
Will people stare?
At me, the boy,
Like a childless toy.
With no soul on my shoulder,
I'm trapped inside a boulder.
With no way out,
I scream and shout.
No one hears me to let me loose,
I'm a featherless goose.
With no chance to fly.

I fear to lose my friends,
To, instead of ignoring, embracing trends.
To be surronded by yes girls and boys.
And too have all the latest must have toys.
A trophy wife, a sports car;
A gold dinner knife and a holiday home on a star.
I fear to lose contract and subract,
From the ones I care for.

I shall walk
and no longer fear;
knowing that you are here
to walk with me
Your love so strong
everlasting and so true
never to be lost,
My heart no longer wanting
I find myself wrapped,
captured by your will
and I shall walk
the path you chose
A love so strong
to last eternally
now that I have found you
I no longer fear
My Lord Jesus...

A shy man
A quiet woman
A meeting of chance
He rambles nervously on
And hopes for a response
The more interested she seems
By her laughs and her smiles
And the increased presence near him
The more he longs to kiss her
But he fears rejection and does not
He hopes for a response
The more interested she seems
He rambles nervously on
This meeting of chance
A quiet woman
A shy man

I'm afraid.
Afraid, I fear
What do I fear?
There's no one here.
No one.
Just me.

Forever I am with you,
Every hour, evey second,
Always ever near.
Realize that you are not forsaken,

Nor ever forgotten, for I am
Observing throughout the night and day.
Turn to me, I'm just a prayer away.

I fear I have lost everything.
Can It be?
I have never felt this way before
it's overwhelming,
it's too much!
This fear is paralyzing, consuming me.
The voice within my soul tells me to fight his fear,
but my heart says different.
It plunges me into all different kinds of confusion and
illusion
illusion about me, you
everything.
Fear is my faithful friend
sometimes comforting, but sometimes frightening me.
Instead of everything, I have gained fear.
It is better to have fear than have nothing at all.
Ah, what a torturous treasure.

Fear not that I will speak of things
I should no longer speak of.
For unspoken words ring louder
sometimes, that the shout from
rooftops. And though they sound
so loud inside me, I will not say
them... No, not even loud enough
for the trees to hear.

And fear not that in knowing you
I will forget, nor that the look in
my eye will change, when you are
no longer here.
How could it change, when
though you go, you take that part
of me with you, that is my very life.

I guess the five hundred Nations were exterminated
I guess slavery was, I guess slavery was

How can the history book over look
The shear fear, fear in the blood sweating tear
Of those terrorized by patriotic psychotics

Terrorism will not be tolerated in the Great Nation
The kkk does not terrorize, just a distant relation

Bombing abortion clinics, targeting homosexuals
Hate crimes of any kind

Terrorism will not be tolerated in this Great Nation
The kkk does not terrorize, just a distant relation

Listen to all the fear, the doubt
Big business demands their hand out
We the public have no clout
Now, who’s on welfare due to economic drought
Billions of dollars freely given out

As the grateful recipients receive economic incentive
Americans receive their pink slip

Billions of dollars go to the railroad tracks
Public terrorized by anthrax
Fed half truths by false facts

Propaganda jumping like a frog
Instead of a flag, wave the dog
Watch’em eat yo money like a greedy hog

The terrorist turn you daylight into a long smooch goodnight
This madness is crazy, fear turned into frustration, everything’s hazy
This blindness terrorizes like a two-edged razor
Makes war seem like a gigantic Fund-raiser

I guess, genocide is just an error-ism
Destruction of The Economic Base is an act of terrorism

If you don’t get saved and become a slave
You’ll burn in hell the preacher did tell

You’re rotten, unrighteous and born vile
You belong to the devil, deceived by his vile
Your fate has been decided, no denial
Tried and convicted without a trial

Go to school but don’t make the grade
Can’t get in college, no financial aid
Can’t get the skills and have no trade
Future looks bleak even fear is afraid

Society doesn’t want you
You don’t have the money they are due
You don’t possess what they require
You’re a mistake and object of friendly fire

Ya spend yo whole life living in dread and fear
Controlled and manipulated by the austere
Help is not allowed to interfere
Life and living is no hope, death won’t appear

Living up to your mentor’s measure
Don’t enjoy yourself and receive pleasure
Be a carbon copy, shallow imitation
Spend yourself as just a fountain of informationSensation of the mind as blackest thought
doth creep upon every walking moment.
I remember it was not what I sought,
these icy rings of eternal torment.
Nothing can describe the painful nightmare
this oft extended, withering grey arm doth bring -
this three hour hell of human despair
of which the invigilator is King.
When over, a thousand sighs of relief
do enter the chillingly silent hall
the now known hand doth re-enter it's sheath,
and now the horror doth truly feel small.
This dream of life leaveth no lasting mark -
But I know this fear lies still in my heart.

I shiver against parental winds
of scarlet and crimson stain
To stand and hear the whirling throws,
the whipping shears of verbal blows
That evoke blustering pain
And in the midst of angry words
lie an expiring soulful sight
Of loves unbinding belief in violent and descending grief
As family ties die

Another tornado warning, power lines
down, the same ring around the rosy.
But there’s no pocketful of posies
for this black plague in my brain.

I am like one of those little pigs,
struck dumb with post-traumatic stress,
waiting for my house to be blown in.

While the storm outside huffs and puffs,
I forget the King’s horses,
the King’s men, wait for the Prozac
to put me back together again.

A night of passion, kisses, hugs, and more
Finding each other, reaching out unsure
Flowers and gifts with words of romance
Both of us afraid to take a chance

Sometimes we fight and make anew
Sometimes I feel like the fool
One thing for sure, can say is true
I’ll always love, how about you

Your love my dear is strong and pure
Only thing is, you do not share
Is there a gift of love from you
Yes there is, but goes to who

Your love my sweet, is held so near
Hidden from me, caused by fear
One day my love, I know it’s true
You will love me, as I do you

I hate myself,
I hate my life,
I know that a slice, a bang, or the sea
Will take it all away.
But I hesitate.
It's not fear I feel.
To take my life to escape,
would be selfish,
to all those people who fight.
Fight for their right to live and argue their existence to themselves.
I hate being selfish.
I don't want to be selfish.
So I endure.
Whatever pain I might come upon.

the room so dark
and waterless too is like a desert,
hot and empty of love
trees once tall welcoming travelers
now rest silent like stone bereft of their buds

arms that have known these eyes
now torment like raw heat,
all they give is a sonic wave of bats

the rain-garnished sunflower in the center
of our dreams is now a lifeless leave golden-hued
its gilded petals adorned with seashells
will soon be buried in memory

humane feelings once the healing balm
has long been vanquished by the sun in a horseplay

not even a blade of nose awaits the traveler
like a figurative art to take his burden
somewhere beyond laughable appraisal

all is a dazzle, a bubble trail of daylight
set in a stare, cobwebbed and rolled
to Downside Park till dead and gone

I never had the courage
To say…
I need you…
More than a friend
I had a
Fear…

My love for you
Is…
Like…
A bird’s love for the sky
A river’s love for the ocean
A cloud’s love for the rain
I told you that…
I definitely told you
But only in dreams…

One day
I decided to
Tell you
About
My heart
That
It always beats for you

I ran
Towards your place
Suddenly
My…
Face turned pale
Blood rushed to face
Body was numb
Legs were frozen

It seemed like midnight
Just in midday

All…
A smile’s love for the lips
A tree’s love for the breeze
A fish’s love for the water
That all …
Love…
Started the flowing of
My eyes

You were busy
Arms holding him tight
Lips locked
And
My lips
Tried to say something
But
They fell to the fear
I always had.

Why are we so scared
When we see the
Opportunities
That we'd prayed for,
Desired with all of our
Hearts,
Unfolding
Right before our eyes,
Though we'd beaten
The air,
Were burned within,
Afraid our dreams
Would never be
Fulfilled?

A rising man
gives his legs,
to me.
A breathing man
gives his lungs,
to me.

A fearless man
gives his courage,
to me.

A man inside, a man deprived
gives his remaining,
to me.

A man of wisdom
gives his mind,
to me.

A man of love
gives his heart,
to me.

A man outside, a man decides
to give his life,
to me.

'I tried, I gave, I lied, I betrayed
I regret, I dwell, I lived, I die
I'm sorry, forgive me, help me, take this life.'

A man took me to his head
and let me breathe,
a man dropped me to the floor
and looked at me...

'I made you fear, out of panic, out of thought
gave you that trigger, gave you that shot
I see now fear, no longer do you blind me
I break you fear, your no longer a piece of me'...

A man gave and a man took,
he now knows he's worth a look,
a man found, a man came to terms,
a man gave me a chance,
let me burn.

A man lives, A man stands,
a man, a better man
gives me thanks.
